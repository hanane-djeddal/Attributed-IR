Bronze was cast into desired shapes and if damaged could be recast. A new tool developed in the copper age is the saw.

Why is voting day on a Tuesday?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '1050340#5', 'text': 'A uniform date for choosing presidential electors was instituted by the Congress in 1845. Many theories have been advanced as to why the Congress settled on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The actual reasons, as shown in records of Congressional debate on the bill in December 1844, were fairly prosaic. The bill initially set the day for choosing presidential electors on ""the first Tuesday in November,"" in years divisible by four (1848, 1852, etc.). But it was pointed out that in some years the period between the first Tuesday in November and the first Wednesday in December (when the electors are required to meet in their state capitals to vote) would be more than 34 days, in violation of the existing Electoral College law. So, the bill was reworded to move the date for choosing presidential electors to the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, a date scheme already used in New York. The period between Election Day and the first Wednesday in December is always 29 days. The effect of the change was to make November 2 the earliest day on which Election Day may fall.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '54635#12', 'text': 'Tuesday is the usual day for elections in the United States.

Tuesday was the earliest day of the week which was practical for polling in the early 19th century: citizens might have to travel for a whole day to cast their vote, and would not wish to leave on Sunday which was a day of worship for the great majority of them. However, a bill was introduced in 2012 to move elections to weekends, with a co-sponsor stating that ""by moving Election Day from a single day in the middle of the work week to a full weekend, we are encouraging more working Americans to participate.

Another context, [2], explains that the presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in November due to factors such as weather, harvests, and worship. Back then, when people traveled to the polls by horse, Tuesday allowed them to worship on Sunday, ride to their county seat on Monday, and vote on Tuesday—all before market day, Wednesday.

Currently, more than half of the antiques and museum objects of Polish heritage stolen by Germans in 1944 have not been returned to Poland. After the war, extensive work was put into rebuilding the city according to pre-war plans and historical documents.

In 1920, during the Polish-Bolshevik War, the Polish Ministry of Interior decided to nationalize the unit. However, the authorities of Warsaw have sued the state authorities and the decision was withdrawn. Until World War II the Warsaw Fire Guards were the only privately owned fire brigade in Poland and one of the very few such units in the world. Officially their status was similar to that of the Municipal Police. The private ownership (most of the shares were held by the city of Warsaw) allowed for fast modernization of the Guards.

The absence of his forces at the battle has been the subject of dispute. A perception arose that his absence was due to his desire to achieve \'military glory\' at Lwów. Telegrams concerning the transfer of forces were exchanged. Leon Trotsky interpreted Stalin\'s actions as insubordination; Richard Pipes asserts that Stalin \'...almost certainly acted on Lenin\'s orders\' in not moving the forces to Warsaw. That the commander-in-chief Sergey Kamenev allowed such insubordination, issued conflicting and confusing orders and did not act with the decisiveness of a commander-in-chief contributed greatly to the problems and defeat the Red forces suffered at this critical junction of the war. The Polish 5th Army under General Władysław Sikorski counter-attacked on 14 August from the area of the Modlin fortress, crossing the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski\'s 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish counter-offensive had been fully joined by Marshal Piłsudski\'s ""Reserve Army."" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzaliński\'s group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet ""Mozyr Group"" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky\'s forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his Minsk headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup.

Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans: The Red Army\'s halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post-war political objectives. In other words: had the Polish Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile would have had legitimacy to continue the pre-war government in Poland, rendering the post-war Polish-communists regime invalid and likely rejected in all of the pre-war Polish areas thus far liberated by the Red Army (the news of planned Warsaw Uprising is likely one of the reason of speeding up the installation of communist regime on 22 July 1944 in Lublin). Also the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans was of direct benefit to Soviet Union, since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to planned (and already started) Soviet occupation.

Although to a large extent it was to follow the line 1 of the pre-war plans, only the central stations were to be located underground. However, by the end of the decade the project was cancelled.

Most of the city authorities were evacuated to the east. Warsaw was left with a military garrison composed mainly of infantry battalions and batteries of artillery. The Headquarters of general Czuma had to organize the defense of the city. Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding among the command. At that time Poland still believed that any time soon Great Britain and France would attack Germany according to the treaties which were signed by these countries at the beginning of 1939.

However, asbestos fibres are inevitably released during machining operations of the objects made of fibre-cement and by long-term erosion of the materials exposed to atmospheric weathering and wind when cement degrades.

Does Christianity come from Judaism?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '20015427#13', 'text': 'For centuries, the traditional understanding has been that Judaism came before Christianity and that Christianity separated from Judaism some time after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.

In the 1st century, many Jewish sects existed in competition with each other, see Second Temple Judaism. The sects which eventually became Rabbinic Judaism and Early Christianity were but two of these. Some scholars have begun to propose a model which envisions a twin birth of Christianity and Judaism rather than a separation of the former from the latter. For example, Robert Goldenberg (2002) asserts that it is increasingly accepted among scholars that ""at the end of the 1st century CE there were not yet two separate religions called ""Judaism"" and ""Christianity"""".

Judaism is known to allow for multiple messiahs, the two most relevant being Messiah ben Joseph and the Messiah ben David.

Alan Segal has written that ""one can speak of a \'twin birth\' of two new Judaisms, both markedly different from the religious systems that preceded them. Not only were rabbinic Judaism and Christianity religious twins, but, like Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac and Rebecca, they fought in the womb, setting the stage for life after the womb."" The first Christians (the disciples or students of Jesus) were essentially all ethnically Jewish or Jewish proselytes. In other words, Jesus was Jewish, preached to the Jewish people and called from them his first disciples. Jewish Christians regarded ""Christianity"" as an affirmation of every aspect of contemporary Judaism, with the addition of one extra belief — that Jesus was the Messiah. The doctrines of the apostles of Jesus brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities (Acts records dispute over the resurrection of the dead, which was rejected by the Sadducees, see also Persecution of Christians in the New Testament), and possibly later led to Christians\' expulsion from synagogues (see Council of Jamnia for other theories).  While Marcionism rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, Proto-orthodox Christianity instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others, see the Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity and Early Christianity.

Numerous planetary mass objects orbit within, or close to, this range and as such receive sufficient sunlight to raise temperatures above the freezing point of water. However their atmospheric conditions vary substantially. The aphelion of Venus, for example, touches the inner edge of the zone and while atmospheric pressure at the surface is sufficient for liquid water, a strong greenhouse effect raises surface temperatures to at which water can only exist as vapour. The entire orbits of the Moon, Mars, and numerous asteroids also lie within various estimates of the habitable zone. Only at Mars' lowest elevations (less than 30% of the planet's surface) is atmospheric pressure and temperature sufficient for water to, if present, exist in liquid form for short periods. At Hellas Basin, for example, atmospheric pressures can reach 1,115 Pa and temperatures above zero Celsius (about the triple point for water) for 70 days in the Martian year. Despite indirect evidence in the form of seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes, no confirmation has been made of the presence of liquid water there. While other objects orbit partly within this zone, including comets, Ceres is the only one of planetary mass. A combination of low mass and an inability to mitigate evaporation and atmosphere loss against the solar wind make it impossible for these bodies to sustain liquid water on their surface. Despite this, studies are strongly suggestive of past liquid water on the surface Venus, Mars, Vesta and Ceres, suggesting a more common phenomena than previously thought. Since sustainable liquid water is thought to be essential to support complex life, most estimates, therefore, are inferred from the effect that a repositioned orbit would have on the habitability of Earth or Venus as their surface gravity allows sufficient atmosphere to be retained for several billion years."", 'title': 'Circumstellar habitable zone'}, {'docid': '1072751#14', 'text': 'Some scientists argue that the concept of a circumstellar habitable zone is actually limited to stars in certain types of systems or of certain spectral types.

In 1968, Marvel graduated its double feature characters appearing in their anthologies to full-length stories in their own comic. But several of these characters could not sustain their own title and were cancelled. Marvel tried to create new double feature anthologies such as ""Amazing Adventures"" and ""Astonishing Tales"" which did not last as double feature comic books. A more enduring concept was that of the team-up book, either combining two characters, at least one of which was not popular enough to sustain its own title (""Green Lantern/Green Arrow"", ""Super-Villain Team-Up"", ""Power Man and Iron Fist"", ""Daredevil and the Black Widow"", ""Captain America and the Falcon"") or a very popular character with a guest star of the month (""Marvel Team-Up"" and ""Marvel Two-in-One"").

Career-oriented girls included such characters as Nellie the Nurse, Tessie the Typist, and Millie the Model, each of whom appeared in comic books working jobs that non-wartime women of the era typically worked. Romance heroines were popular in the romance genre, pioneered by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Typically, the heroine was either a ""good girl"" or ""bad girl"", with both roles having small effect on a male character\'s decision. In the Archie Comics, the titular character can never definitively chose between his two love interests Betty and Veronica, who typify this dichotomy between the good Girl-Next-Door and the dangerous allure of her foil respectively. The duo got their own title in 1950, Betty and Veronica (comic book), which quickly became a popular comic, featuring the two lead characters continuing to obsess over boys and fight over who would get to date Archie. Female costumed crimefighters were among the early comics characters. One of the comics\' earliest female superheroes appeared in newspaper strips, the Invisible Scarlet O\'Neil by Russell Stamm. The tough-fighting Miss Fury, debuted in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills in 1941.

When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book ""Seduction of the Innocent"" (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency from the parents of the children to the comic books they read.

Where do fire ants live?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '17204904#4', 'text': 'The introduction of invasive species, mainly the red fire ant, has been known to disrupt the beetle’s environment. Shallow caves in which the beetle live are relatively easy to enter and make them vulnerable to invasion of fire ants and other exotic species. Fire ant colonies occur in two different forms: single-queen colonies and multiple-queen colonies. It is the multiple-queen colonies that pose a threat because they occur in very dense concentrations of about 750–5000 mounds per acre. They can enter through the cave entrance or crawl through small holes or cracks and attack the karst species where humans cannot observe. Slow moving adults, nymphs, and eggs are most vulnerable to fire ant predation. More than 50% of the caves observed had fire ants present. This is a large sign that the fire ant has taken over or will eventually take over the habitat. Even if the fire ant does not prey on the beetle it is likely to change the links that are critical in the food chain.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '377204#4', 'text': 'A typical fire ant colony produces large mounds in open areas, and feeds mostly on young plants and seeds. Fire ants often attack small animals and can kill them. Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom called solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines. For humans, this is a painful sting, a sensation similar to what one feels when burned by fire (hence the name), and the after effects of the sting can be deadly to sensitive people. Fire ants are more aggressive than most native species, so have pushed many species away from their local habitat. One such species that ""Solenopsis"" ants parasitically take advantage of are bees, such as ""Euglossa imperialis"", a nonsocial orchid bee species, from which the ants would enter the cells from below the nest and rob the cell\'s contents. These ants are renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions.

These secondary sources published during the 1920s, are the source of the statistics in reference works listing casualties in World War I. This article summarizes the casualty statistics published in the official government reports of the United States and Great Britain as well as France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Austria and Russia. More recently the research of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has revised the military casualty statistics of the UK and its allies; they include in their listing of military war dead personnel outside of combat theaters and civilians recruited from Africa, the Middle East and China who provided logistical and service support in combat theaters. The casualties of these support personnel recruited outside of Europe were previously not included with British war dead, however the casualties of the Labour Corps recruited from the British Isles were included in the rolls of British war dead published in 1921.

The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 42%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine, typhus, or Spanish flu rather than combat action.

A 2005 Polish study estimated 3,376,800 Poles were conscripted into the armed forces of these countries during World War I, an additional 300,000 were conscripted for forced labor by the Germans. The Russians and Austrians forcibly resettled 1.6 to 1.8\xa0million persons from the war zone in Poland.

In the closing stages of the Battle of Naseby Okey\'s Dragoons, who had started the action as dismounted musketeers, got on their horses and charged, possibly the first time this was done. Supplied with inferior horses and more basic equipment, the dragoon regiments were cheaper to recruit and maintain than the expensive regiments of cavalry.

The endocrine role of the pancreas in metabolism, and indeed the existence of insulin, was further clarified in 1921, when Sir Frederick Grant Banting and Charles Herbert Best repeated the work of Von Mering and Minkowski, and went further to demonstrate they could reverse induced diabetes in dogs by giving them an extract from the pancreatic islets of Langerhans of healthy dogs.

Is Pearl beer still in production?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '4825833#46', 'text': ""In 1952, when the San Antonio Brewing Association changed its name to the Pearl Brewing Company, the triple Xs joined the Pearl name as a dominant image on the product and the company as a whole.

The Xs held this significant role to the end of production at the brewery in 2001, when the brewery closed its doors and the company logo was abandoned. As production of Pearl and Pearl Light spun up at Miller's Fort Worth facility, the product logos were redesigned. The updated label does not use the triple Xs, so a significant part of company identity has been virtually eliminated from the Pearl beers. However, Pearl's Country Club malt liquor still displays the XXXs in its logo. Many people wonder where the Xs came from, and how were they ever used on beer. In truth, the three Xs are actually a quality rating system. The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. The courier's job was to sample beer at inns along the way. If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn's sign or door with a single X. If the inn's beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs.

By the time of the pontificate of Paul III, the Reform movement had swept much of Europe away from the Catholic Church.

Although the Elector did not at first share the new attitude, he granted his protection to Luther anyway. Owing to this intervention, Pope Leo X decided against summoning Luther to Rome in 1518, and the Elector secured for Luther Imperial safe-conduct to the Diet of Worms in 1521.

In January 1604, King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference, where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans, who preferred the Geneva Bible. The King James version slowly took over the place of the Geneva Bible had among the Puritans.

This name was also found as King James\' Bible (without the final ""s""): for example in a book review from 1811. The ""phrase"" ""King James\'s Bible"" is used as far back as 1715, although in this case it is not clear whether this is a name or merely a description.'}, {'idx': 3, 'docid': '173400#24', 'text': 'In 1604, the year after he claimed the throne of England in 1603, King James I hosted and presided over a conference pertaining to matters religious, the Hampton Court Conference. While the Geneva Bible was the preferred Bible of Anglican and Puritan Protestants during the Elizabethan Age, King James I disliked the Geneva Bible and made his views clearly known at the conference: ""I think that of all [English Bibles], that of Geneva is the worst."" Apparently, his distaste for the Geneva Bible was not necessarily caused just by the translation of the text into English, but mostly the annotations in the margins. He felt strongly many of the annotations were ""very partial, untrue, seditious, and savoring too much of dangerous and traitorous conceits..."" In all likelihood, he saw the Geneva\'s interpretations of biblical passages as anti-clerical ""republicanism"", which could imply church hierarchy was unnecessary. Other passages appeared particularly seditious: notably references to monarchs as ""tyrants"". It followed that the need for a king as head of church and state could be questioned also. James had been dealing with similar issues with the Presbyterian-Calvinist religious leaders back in Scotland, and he wanted none of the same controversies in England. Also, if annotations were in print, readers might believe these interpretations correct and fixed, making it more difficult to change his subjects\' minds about the meanings of particular passages. So when towards the end of the conference two Puritans suggested that a new translation of the Bible be produced to unify better the Anglican Church in England and Scotland, James embraced the idea. He could not only be rid of those inconvenient annotations, but he could have greater influence on the translation of the Bible as a whole. He commissioned and chartered a new translation of the Bible which would eventually become the most famous version of the Bible in the history of the English language. Originally known as the ""Authorized Version"" to be read in churches, the new Bible would come to bear his name as the so-called King James Bible or King James Version (KJV). The first and early editions of the King James Bible from 1611 and the first few decades thereafter lack annotations, unlike nearly all editions of the Geneva Bible up until that time. Initially, the King James Version did not sell well and competed with the Geneva Bible. Shortly after the first edition of the KJV, King James banned the printing of new editions of the Geneva Bible to further entrench his version. However, Robert Barker continued to print Geneva Bibles even after the ban, placing the erroneous date 1599 on new copies of Genevas which were actually printed circa 1616 to 1625. Despite popular misconception, the Puritan Separatists or Pilgrim Fathers aboard the ""Mayflower"" in 1620 brought to North America copies of the Geneva Bible.Text'}, {'idx': 4, 'docid': '174117#5', 'text': 'The translators of the King James Bible were instructed to take the 1602 edition of the Bishops\' Bible as their basis, although several other existing translations were taken into account.

Later judgments of the Bishops\' Bible have not been favorable; David Daniell, in his important edition of William Tyndale\'s New Testament, states that the Bishops\' Bible ""was, and is, not loved. Where it reprints Geneva it is acceptable, but most of the original work is incompetent, both in its scholarship and its verbosity"". Jack P. Lewis, in his book ""The Day after Domesday: The Making of the Bishops\' Bible"", notes that unsympathetic reviews of this Bible have been done. However, ""Granting all the shortcomings eighteenth to twenty-first-century scholarship can find in the Bishops\' Bible, it was an important stage in moving English people from prohibited Bible reading to being a Bible-reading people.

Lucha libre wrestlers are known as ""luchadores"" (singular ""luchador,"" meaning ""wrestler""). They usually come from extended wrestling families who form their own stables. One such line integrated into the United States professional wrestling scene is Los Guerreros.

The concept of lucha libre originated in Mexico during the 1930s and gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. It was influenced by traditional Mexican folk heroes and the American professional wrestling scene. Over time, lucha libre evolved and developed its distinct style, which includes high-flying acrobatics, technical skills, and dramatic storytelling.

In Japan, Universal Lucha Libre was a professional wrestling promotion from 1990 to 1995. The name Universal Lucha Libre is used to differentiate the promotion from the Japanese UWF, which presented a very different style of professional wrestling. Although the Japanese promotion had an impact on the globalization of lucha libre, the core essence of lucha libre as a Mexican wrestling style remains its defining characteristic.

In conclusion, Lucha Libre comes from its Mexican roots, with its origins in the Mexican soap opera lucha libre, which combines elements of wrestling, acrobatics, and theater. The term ""lucha libre"" was adopted to represent this unique form of Mexican entertainment. It has since evolved and gained popularity worldwide, with influences from the Japanese wrestling scene, but its Mexican heritage remains an essential part of its identity."

They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses, at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another. Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon, which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points.

This illustrates that Japan's naval ambition was to have a significant fleet, with a focus on battleships and cruisers.

This instinctual cub-killing behavior is believed to be inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, as non-killing behavior may have died out due to less successful reproduction [1].

Newly dominant male lions are known to kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire, as it helps maintain their dominance and ensures their genes are passed on to the next generation. This behavior is supported by the context of [1]. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to tolerate other lionesses' cubs, demonstrating that there are exceptions to the general rule of cub killing [2].

Weaning typically occurs after six or seven months, and lion males reach maturity at around three years of age. They can challenge and displace adult males associated with another pride around the age of four to five years old. However, as they age and weaken, they become more susceptible to predation, starvation, and abandonment. When new males displace the existing pride members, they often kill the existing young cubs to ensure their genes continue to thrive in the pride [3].

Cubs also face various threats to their survival, including starvation, abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs. Up to 80% of lion cubs die before the age of two, highlighting the challenges they face in their early lives [4].

In conclusion, lions kill their own cubs primarily to ensure the survival and reproduction of their own offspring by eliminating competition for resources and maintaining their genetic dominance in the pride. This behavior is adaptive and inherited through the genes of successful male lions, as non-killing behavior has likely died out due to less successful reproduction."

In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to acculturate the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity.

What year were specialty drugs designated?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '48172434#0', 'text': 'Specialty drugs or specialty pharmaceuticals are a recent designation of pharmaceuticals that are classified as high-cost, high complexity and/or high touch. Specialty drugs are often biologics—""drugs derived from living cells"" that are injectable or infused (although some are oral medications). They are used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, H.I.V. psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and hepatitis C. In 1990 there were 10 specialty drugs on the market, in the mid-1990s there were fewer than 30, by 2008 there were 200, and by 2015 there were 300. Drugs are often defined as specialty because their price is much higher than that of non-specialty drugs. Medicare defines any drug for which the negotiated price is $670 per month or more, as a specialty drug which is placed in a specialty tier that requires a higher patient cost sharing. Drugs are also identified as specialty when there is a special handling requirement or the drug is only available via a limited distributions network. By 2015 ""specialty medications accounted for one-third of all spending on drugs in the United States, up from 19 percent in 2004 and heading toward 50 percent in the next 10 years"", according to IMS Health, which tracks prescriptions.

When was written music first developed?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '6668778#31', 'text': 'The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. Monophonic chant, also called plainsong or Gregorian chant, was the dominant form until about 1100. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Polyphonic (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, including the more complex voicings of motets. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of instrumentation, multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first bass instruments. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a staff and other elements of musical notation began to take shape. This invention made possible the separation of the composition of a piece of music from its ""transmission""; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted.

Since that time, three main educational models have developed in the USA—the Ph.D. Clinical Science model (heavily focused on research), the Ph.D. science-practitioner model (integrating research and practice), and the Psy.D. practitioner-scholar model (focusing on clinical practice). In the UK and the Republic of Ireland the Clinical Psychology Doctorate falls between the latter two of these models, whilst in much of mainland Europe the training is at masters level and predominantly psychotherapeutic.

What is the national dish of Brazil?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '623596#10', 'text': 'According to legend, the origins of Brazil’s national dish, feijoada, stem from the country’s history with slavery.

However, this theory has recently been contested and considered more of a modern advertising technique for the dish rather than a basis for its origins. Instead, scholars argue that the history of feijoada traces back to Brazil’s cultivation of black beans. Because of the crop’s relatively low cost of production and the simplicity of its maintenance, the beans became a staple food among European settlers in Brazil.

Was CoRot successful?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '208691#29', 'text': 'A large number of binary systems with non-radially pulsating members were observed by CoRoT. Some of them, which were eclipsing binaries with members of γ Doradus type, were discovered during CoRoT runs. The eclipse phenomenon plays a key role since global parameters can immediately follow, bringing invaluable constraints, in addition to the seismic ones, to stellar modeling.To find extra solar planets, CoRoT uses the method of transits detection. The primary transit is the occultation of a fraction of the light from a star when a celestial object, such as a planet, passes between the star and the observer. Its detection is made possible by the sensitivity of CCD to very small changes in light flux. Corot is capable of detecting changes in brightness of about 1/10,000. Scientists can thus hope finding planets with a size of approximately 2 times that of the Earth with this method, a class of planet called Super-Earth; detection of Corot-7b, whose radius is 1.7 times that of the Earth has shown that these predictions were correct. Corot takes an exposure of 32 seconds duration, each 32 seconds, but the image is not fully transmitted to Earth because the data flow would be too large. The onboard computer performs an important work of data reduction: the field around each target star, previously selected by the exoplanets team, is defined on a certain number of pixels described by a particular mask, the sum all pixels within the mask is then performed and several exposures are added (usually 16, which amounts to an integration time of about 8 minutes) before sending this information to the ground. For some stars, considered particularly of interest, data of each exposure is transmitted every 32 seconds. Such a sampling of 32s or 512s is well suited to the detection of a planetary transit that lasts from a little less than an hour to several hours. A feature of this method is that it requires to detect at least three successive transits separated by two equal time intervals before one can consider a target as a serious candidate. A planet of orbital period ""T"" should at least be observed for a time interval between 2""T"" and 3""T"" to have a chance to detect three transits. The distance of the planet to the star ( which is characterized by ""a"" the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit ) is linked to its orbital period by the second law of Kepler / Newton ""a"" = ""T"" M, using respectively as units for ""a"", M and ""T"": the distance from the Earth to the Sun (150 million km), the mass of the Sun, the orbital period of the Earth (1 year); this implies that if the observing time is less a year, for example, the orbits of the detectable planets will be significantly smaller than that of the Earth. So, for Corot, due to the maximum duration of 6 months of observation for each star field, only planets closer to their stars than 0.3 Astronomical Units (less than the distance between the Sun and Mercury) can be detected, therefore generally not in the so-called habitable zone. The Kepler mission (NASA) has continuously observed the same field for many years and thus had the ability to detect Earth sized planets located farther from their stars.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '208691#23', 'text': 'Whether RGB or RC, these stars all have an extended convective envelope favorable to the excitation of solar-like oscillations. A major success of CoRoT has been the discovery of radial and long-lived non-radial oscillations in thousands of red giants in the exo field. For each of them, the frequency at maximum power ν in the frequency spectrum as well as the large frequency separation between consecutive modes Δν could be measured, defining a sort of individual seismic passport.Massive variable main sequence stars have frequency spectra dominated by acoustic modes excited by the κ mechanism at work in layers where partial ionization of iron group elements produce a peak in opacity. In addition the most advanced of these stars present mixed modes i.e. modes with a g-character in deep layers and p-character in the envelope. Hydrogen burning takes place in a convective core surrounded by a region of varying chemical composition and an envelope mostly radiative except for tiny convective layers related to partial ionization of helium and/or iron group elements.

The United States Army issued four machine guns per regiment in 1912, but that allowance increased to 336 machine guns per regiment by 1919. Heavy guns based on the Maxim such as the Vickers machine gun were joined by many other machine weapons, which mostly had their start in the early 20th century such as the Hotchkiss machine gun. Submachine guns (e.g., the German MP 18) as well as lighter machine guns (the first light machine gun deployed in any significant number being the Madsen machine gun, with the Chauchat and Lewis gun soon following) saw their first major use in World War I, along with heavy use of large-caliber machine guns.

When was special relativity discovered?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '198507#26', 'text': 'In 1905, Albert Einstein published the principle of special relativity, which soon became a theory.

He thereby duplicated the Lorentz transformation and the Lorentz contraction that had been hypothesized to resolve experimental riddles and inserted into electrodynamic theory as dynamical consequences of the aether\'s properties. An elegant theory, special relativity yielded its own consequences, such as the equivalence of mass and energy transforming into one another and the resolution of the paradox that an excitation of the electromagnetic field could be viewed in one reference frame as electricity, but in another as magnetism.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '26962#0', 'text': 'In physics, special relativity (SR, also known as the special theory of relativity or STR) is the generally accepted and experimentally well-confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time.

The inconsistency of Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell\'s equations of electromagnetism and the lack of experimental confirmation for a hypothesized luminiferous aether led to the development of special relativity, which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving motions at a significant fraction of the speed of light (known as """").

According to him, it was Poincaré\'s unsystematic and sometimes erroneous statements regarding his philosophical papers (often connected with conventionalism), which hindered many to give him due credit. In his opinion, Poincaré was rather a ""structural realist"" and from that he concludes, that Poincaré actually adhered to the relativity of time and space, while his allusions to the aether are of secondary importance. He continues, that due to his treatment of gravitation and four-dimensional space, Poincaré\'s 1905/6-paper was superior to Einstein\'s 1905-paper.

Working with Lorentz\'s aether theory, Henri Poincaré, having earlier proposed the ""relativity principle"" as a general law of nature (including electrodynamics and gravitation), used this principle in 1905 to correct Lorentz\'s preliminary transformation formulas, resulting in an exact set of equations that are now called the Lorentz transformations. A little later in the same year Albert Einstein published his original paper on special relativity in which, again based on the relativity principle, he independently derived and radically reinterpreted the Lorentz transformations by changing the fundamental definitions of space and time intervals, while abandoning the absolute simultaneity of Galilean kinematics, thus avoiding the need for any reference to a luminiferous aether in classical electrodynamics.

This method was criticized by many scholars, since the assumption of a conspiracy of effects which completely prevent the discovery of the aether drift is considered to be very improbable, and it would violate Occam\'s razor as well. Einstein is considered the first who completely dispensed with such auxiliary hypotheses and drew the direct conclusions from the facts stated above: that the relativity principle is correct and the directly observed speed of light is the same in all inertial reference frames. Based on his axiomatic approach, Einstein was able to derive ""all results"" obtained by his predecessors\xa0– and in addition the formulas for the relativistic Doppler effect and relativistic aberration\xa0– in a few pages, while prior to 1905 his competitors had devoted years of long, complicated work to arrive at the same mathematical formalism. Before 1905 Lorentz and Poincaré had adopted these same principles, as necessary to achieve their final results, but didn\'t recognize that they were also sufficient in the sense that there was no immediate logical need to assume the existence of a stationary aether in order to arrive at the Lorentz transformations. Another reason for Einstein\'s early rejection of the aether in any form (which he later partially retracted) may have been related to his work on quantum physics. Einstein discovered that light can also be described (at least heuristically) as a kind of particle, so the aether as the medium for electromagnetic ""waves"" (which was highly important for Lorentz and Poincaré) no longer fitted into his conceptual scheme.'}]","[{'answer': 'The principle of special relativity was discovered by Albert Einstein in 1905 [1][2][5]', 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 0, 'sentences': [{'text': 'The principle of special relativity was discovered by Albert Einstein in 1905 [1][2][5]', 'index': 0, 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 0}]}, {'answer': 'Albert Einstein published the principle of special relativity in 1905, which soon became a theory.

This process is designed to ensure a smooth transition of power and maintain continuity in the government. Additionally, when a Vice President succeeds to the Presidency or dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the Vice Presidency remains vacant until the inauguration of the Vice President chosen in the next presidential election. This process is meant to ensure that the President and Vice President serving in the next term are elected through a democratic process.

Context [2] highlights that the U.S. Constitution, including the presidential line of succession, dictates what happens when a president is incapacitated. The line of succession is defined in Article II, Section 1, and it specifies the order in which the executive duties of the presidency are transferred when a president is unable to fulfill their duties. The line of succession begins with the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate, followed by the Secretary of State.

In summary, when the Vice President and President of the USA die at the same time, special elections are held to elect a new President and Vice President to complete the pending presidential term. This process is guided by the U.S. Constitution's presidential line of succession, which ensures a smooth transition of power and continuity in the government."

When did India gain its independence from the British Empire?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '29269#27', 'text': ""In 1947, India gained independence from the British Empire. The empire was in decline but adapted to these circumstances by creating the British Commonwealth—since 1949 the Commonwealth of Nations—which is a free association of equal states. As India obtained its independence, multiple ethnic conflicts emerged in relation to the formation of a statehood during the Partition of India which resulted in Islamic Pakistan and Secular India. Before the advent of the British, no empire based in mainland India had controlled any part of what now makes up the country's Northeast, part of the reason for the ongoing insurgency in Northeast India.

From the late 1920s on, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had a long-standing interest in world affairs among independence leaders, formulated the Congress stance on international issues.

How large is the Sahara desert?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '7331512#1', 'text': ""The Sahara is a vast desert of northern Africa, measuring about 932 miles from north to south and 2484 miles from east to west, and dotted with oases which are centres of population. Eight years after the journey of the French explorer Henri Duveyrier (1859–61), which had important scientific results, Pope Pius IX on 6 August 1868 appointed the Archbishop of Algiers, Mgr Charles Lavigerie, delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan. In the same year the Jesuits established themselves at Laghouat, the extremity occupied by French arms. In 1871 they sent to Mgr Lavigerie a long report in which they advocated the establishment of dispensaries and schools. In 1872 Father Charmetant and two other White Fathers (Missionary Fathers of Africa of Algiers) replaced the Jesuits at Laghouat. In 1873 the White Fathers established themselves at Biskra, Ouargla, Touggart and Gerryville. Later a station was founded at Melili in M'zab. Two successive attempts were made by the White Fathers to reach the Sudan region by crossing the Sahara, thus reaching Timbuktu, a large market for black slaves, there to join in the struggle against slavery. The first attempt was made in December, 1878, by Fathers Menoret, Paulmier and Bouchand; they were slain in April, 1876 by their Touarag guides, being the first martyrs of the Society of White Fathers, and the cause of their beatification was introduced at Rome in 1909. After this disaster the White Fathers founded two stations, not farther north in the desert, but to the north-east, at Tripoli and Ghadames, both in Libya. The massacre of the explorer Flatters and his companions (1880–81) did not discourage the White Fathers in their second attempt to cross the Sahara. In 1881 Father Richard set out from Ghadames, having become so Arabian in speech and bearing that no one suspected his nationality. He intended to establish himself with Fathers Morat and Pouplard at Ghat in the midst of the Libyan desert, but all three were assassinated.""}]","[{'answer': 'The Sahara desert is about 932 miles from north to south and 2,484 miles from east to west [1].', 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1, 'sentences': [{'text': 'The Sahara desert is about 932 miles from north to south and 2,484 miles from east to west [1].', 'index': 0, 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1}]}, {'answer': 'The Sahara desert measures about 932 miles from north to south and 2484 miles from east to west [1].', 'answer_type': 'short', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1, 'sentences': [{'text': 'The Sahara desert measures about 932 miles from north to south and 2484 miles from east to west [1].', 'index': 0, 'answer_type': 'short', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1}]}]","[{'docid': '52602971#3', 'text': 'Throughout the 14th century, much of African trade revolved around the Trans-Saharan trade routes.

Heavy water (D2O) has a molecular mass that is not substantially different from that of normal water (H2O) because about 89% of the molecular weight comes from the single oxygen atom, rather than the two hydrogen atoms. This means that the molecular weight of water can be considered as the sum of the molecular masses of its isotopic forms, with heavy water being a part of it.

Based on the given contexts, we can conclude that the molecular weight of water is a combination of its normal water form (H2O) and heavy water (D2O), with the latter contributing about 10% to the overall molecular weight. Therefore, the molecular weight of water can be approximated as follows:

Molecular weight of water = (18.0153(3) g/mol * 100) + (0.10 * 22.0277364(9) u)

Molecular weight of water ≈ 1820.0153 g/mol (rounded to two decimal places)

Who first identified the cell?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '102858#0', 'text': 'In biology, cell theory is the historic scientific theory, now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of cells, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to microscopes over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to Robert Hooke, and began the scientific study of cells, also known as cell biology. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann. However, many other scientists like Rudolf Virchow contributed to the theory.

This process strengthened natural rubber and prevented it from melting with heat without losing flexibility. This made practical products such as waterproofed articles possible. It also facilitated practical manufacture of such rubberized materials. Vulcanized rubber represents the first commercially successful product of polymer research. In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or viscose rayon, as a substitute for silk, but it was very flammable.

The French troops greeted the approaching hare with a lot of noise. Some troops at the rear of the French formation mistook the noise as a sign of an imminent English attack and prepared for battle. As a preparation for the battle the William II, Count of Hainaut quickly knighted 14 distinguished squires as was the common chivalric custom.

Crabbe was well positioned to serve the King in this task, and from 4 April to 12 August 1339 was with the Admiral of the Fleet North of the Thames, Robert de Morley, 2nd Baron Morley. During this period he is known to have been in command, at one time, of a hundred archers, and on a second occasion, of eight men-at-arms, seventy archers and seventy sailors. In an attempt to prevent the English from using the Low Countries as their base, Philip VI of France gathered a fleet at the mouths of the Zwin and Scheldt, and Edward III, prepared to attack immediately, met at Orwell with his council, where John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, Morley and Crabbe urged him to delay until a larger fleet could be assembled. The King did so with reluctance, and with a larger fleet engaged the French in the Battle of Sluys on the afternoon of 23 June; by the end of the day the English had virtually annihilated the enemy. A few French ships led by a pirate named Spoudevisch managed to escape, and at the King's order were pursued by Crabbe. Unfortunately whether Crabbe succeeded or failed in this endeavour is unknown.

This habitat extends as far north as the tree line (replaced by the High Arctic tundra) and discontinues in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests to the south. The ""taiga"", as it is called there, of Eurasia occupies a similar range on those continents. Throughout the Northern Hemisphere, the boreal forest covers 2.3 million square miles, a larger area than the remaining Brazilian Amazon rain forest. Although it is largely forest, the boreal forests include a network of lakes, river valleys, wetlands, peat lands and semi-open tundra. Only 8% of the Canadian boreal forest is protected and over 30% has already been designated for logging, energy and other development, much of it within the last decade. The U.S. is the leading importer of Canadian wood products as well as oil and gas, having purchased 20 billion dollars (approximately 80% of Canada\'s timber exports) worth of Canadian forest products in 2001. Presently trees being logged in the Boreal are primarily pulped and turned into disposable products such as toilet tissue, junk mail, and catalogs. Decisions will be made in the next several years regarding the remaining lands and where development will take place.'}, {'idx': 3, 'docid': '31302#2', 'text': 'A different use of the term taiga is often encountered in the English language, with ""boreal forest"" used in the United States and Canada to refer to only the more southerly part of the biome, while ""taiga"" is used to describe the more barren areas of the northernmost part of the biome approaching the tree line and the tundra biome. Hoffman (1958) discusses the origin of this differential use in North America and why it is an inappropriate differentiation of the Russian term. Although at high elevations taiga grades into alpine tundra through Krummholz, it is not exclusively an alpine biome; and unlike subalpine forest, much of taiga is lowlands. Taiga is the world\'s second-largest land biome, after deserts and xeric shrublands, covering or 11.5% of the land area of the Earth. The largest areas are located in Russia and Canada. The taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures after the tundra and permanent ice caps. Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra. The lowest reliably recorded temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded in the taiga of northeastern Russia. The taiga or boreal forest has a subarctic climate with very large temperature range between seasons, but the long and cold winter is the dominant feature. This climate is classified as ""Dfc"", ""Dwc"", ""Dsc"", ""Dfd"" and ""Dwd"" in the Köppen climate classification scheme, meaning that the short summer (24\xa0h average 10\xa0°C (50\xa0°F) or more) lasts 1–3 months and always less than 4 months. In Siberian taiga the average temperature of the coldest month is between and . There are also some much smaller areas grading towards the oceanic ""Cfc"" climate with milder winters, whilst the extreme south and (in Eurasia) west of the taiga reaches into humid continental climates (""Dfb"", ""Dwb"") with longer summers. The mean annual temperature generally varies from −5\xa0°C to 5\xa0°C (23\xa0°F to 41\xa0°F), but there are taiga areas in eastern Siberia and interior Alaska-Yukon where the mean annual reaches down to −10\xa0°C (14\xa0°F). According to some sources, the boreal forest grades into a temperate mixed forest when mean annual temperature reaches about 3\xa0°C (37\xa0°F). Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas with mean annual temperature below 0\xa0°C, whilst in the ""Dfd"" and ""Dwd"" climate zones continuous permafrost occurs and restricts growth to very shallow-rooted trees like Siberian larch. The winters, with average temperatures below freezing, last five to seven months. Temperatures vary from −54\xa0°C to 30\xa0°C (−65\xa0°F to 86\xa0°F) throughout the whole year. The summers, while short, are generally warm and humid.

Many approached starvation and were forced to eat leaves from trees and bushes. Many were forced to engage in a ""drill"" that included rolling, creeping, hopping, and running for 75 minutes while camp guards kicked and beat them, while others, forced to work in stone quarries, were refused medical attention when sick.

Clan tradition states that he was a minor at the time of his father\'s death and for six years an incompetent guardian led the clan to its lowest point in clan history. After reaching the age of maturity, Iain Borb managed to acquire some of the clan\'s lost lands and led his clan and his kinsmen (the MacLeods of Lewis) in the Battle of Harlaw, in 1411.

During the hunt, Iain Ciar expressed his anger that they had not come across the white stag that was known to live in the area; the MacLeod chief offered a large reward to whoever could discover the offender who had killed the animal. An enemy of the MacGhitthich chief put the blame on MacGhitthich and in consequence, Iain Ciar had MacGhitthich cruelly put to death by forcing the antlers of a large deer into his bowels. When the hunting party returned to Rodel, intending to set sail for Dunvegan, the vengeful MacGhitthiches attacked the MacLeods. Iain Ciar was struck by an arrow. His son, William Cleireach managed to rally his clan and fend off the attackers. Iain Ciar\'s wife, three of his illegitimate daughters, and other women, fled the hostilities in a galley.

Perhaps the most incredible was the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on 24 August 1916. This company had ten Vickers guns, and it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for twelve hours onto a selected area away in order to prevent German troops forming up there for a counter-attack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantrymen were allocated as carriers of ammunition, rations and water for the machine-gunners. Two men worked a belt-filling machine non-stop for twelve hours keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. 100 new barrels were used up, and all the water, including the men’s drinking water and contents of the latrine buckets, was used to keep the guns cool. In that twelve-hour period the ten guns fired a million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000 from their gun to win a five franc prize offered to the highest-scoring gun. At the end of operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one gun had broken down during the whole period. It was this reliability which endeared the Vickers to the soldiers that used it. It rarely broke down; it just kept on firing. Demand from the British Army for Vickers machine guns was so high that Vickers had to find new ways of increasing production and by 1915 Vickers had supplied the British armed forces with 2,405 guns.

In his obituary, Stephen Prince wrote, ""Lou Lombardo\'s seminal contribution to the history of editing is his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), directed by Sam Peckinpah. The complex montages of violence that Lombardo created for that film influenced generations of filmmakers and established the modern cinematic textbook for editing violent gun battles."" Several critics have remarked on the ""strange, elastic quality"" of time in the film, and have discerned the film\'s influence in the work of directors John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, Kathryn Bigelow, and the Wachowskis, among others. While Lombardo\'s collaboration with Peckinpah lasted just a few years, his career was intertwined with that of director Robert Altman for more than thirty years. Lombardo edited Altman\'s 1971 film ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" (1971), which had ""a radical approach to the use of dialogue and indeed other sound, both in and beyond the frame.""

When did Voltaire publish Candide?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '6629#7', 'text': 'It is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote ""Candide"", but scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while living at Les Délices near Geneva and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote ""Candide"" in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise ""Candide"", but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. ""Candide"" is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest. There is only one extant manuscript of ""Candide"" that was written before the work\'s 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the ""La Vallière Manuscript"". It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l\'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The ""La Vallière Manuscript"", the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of ""Candide"", was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to this manuscript, there is believed to have been another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered. Voltaire published ""Candide"" simultaneously in five countries no later than 15 January 1759, although the exact date is uncertain. Seventeen versions of ""Candide"" from 1759, in the original French, are known today, and there has been great controversy over which is the earliest. More versions were published in other languages: ""Candide"" was translated once into Italian and thrice into English that same year. The complicated science of calculating the relative publication dates of all of the versions of ""Candide"" is described at length in Wade\'s article ""The First Edition of ""Candide"": A Problem of Identification"". The publication process was extremely secretive, probably the ""most clandestine work of the century"", because of the book\'s obviously illicit and irreverent content. The greatest number of copies of ""Candide"" were published concurrently in Geneva by Cramer, in Amsterdam by Marc-Michel Rey, in London by Jean Nourse, and in Paris by Lambert. ""Candide"" underwent one major revision after its initial publication, in addition to some minor ones. In 1761, a version of ""Candide"" was published that included, along with several minor changes, a major addition by Voltaire to the twenty-second chapter, a section that had been thought weak by the Duke of Vallière. The English title of this edition was ""Candide, or Optimism, Translated from the German of Dr. Ralph. With the additions found in the Doctor\'s pocket when he died at Minden, in the Year of Grace 1759."" The last edition of ""Candide"" authorised by Voltaire was the one included in Cramer\'s 1775 edition of his complete works, known as , in reference to the border or frame around each page.

Rasselas questions his choices in life and what new choices to make in order to achieve this happiness.

What do airsoft guns shoot?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '28498#23', 'text': 'Airsoft is a competitive sport similar in concept to paintball, in which participants from opposing teams eliminate opponents by hitting each other with solid round plastic pellets launched from low-powered smoothbore air guns called airsoft guns. It is different to paintball in that airsoft pellets do not visibly mark the targets like paintballs, and thus the sport relies heavily on an honor system where a hit player has the ethical duty to call himself out of play, regardless of whether anyone else sees it happen. Most airsoft guns are also magazine-fed (unlike the commonly top-mounting pellet loader of paintball markers) with mounting platforms compatible with real firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns in appearance, making them more popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. The greater toughness of airsoft pellets also allows the use of better powerplants and apparatus such as hop-up device for improved external ballistics, making the gameplay more accurately resemble real gunfights. They are also much cheaper for casual players to participate than paintball.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '172997#4', 'text': 'Airsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, trademarked as ""soft air guns"", tailoring to the needs of shooting enthusiasts while conforming to Japan\'s strict gun control. The name ""soft air"" referred to the compressed Freon-silicone oil mixture (known as ""green gas"") that was used as a propellant, which was significantly weaker than the carbon dioxide used in proper airguns. Originally designed for target shooting, their plastic pellets can be shot at humans without causing injury and this became popular for casual war-games. Airsoft guns spread to the UK in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a company called LS. The guns were sold in pieces and had to be assembled before they were capable of firing pellets. Airsoft equipment was designed to closely emulate real guns. Since the mid-1980s, airsoft guns have been adapted with a purely recreational application in mind, and the sport is enjoyed by all ages.

After the 2nd instar they start to get skittish. Nymphs are known to play dead. If startled sometimes nymphs will jump up into the air and fall face up or down to the ground with their legs pulled in. Adults and nymphs are known to do a threat pose when startled. ""Deroplatys lobata"" are aggressive toward each other and they will sometimes eat each other so they should not be kept together in captivity. Younger nymphs are not very aggressive toward each other so can be kept together and there will rarely be any cannibalism if they are fed enough. From the 1st instar to adult they often threaten each other by doing a threat pose and striking to scare off the other mantis. After laying the ootheca the female sits on her ootheca to defend it. \nThese mantids need a very humid environment. Misting them heavily directly onto the mantis every evening works well. To keep the humidity up, substrate like moist sphagnum moss can be added but is not needed. ""Deroplatys lobata"" do well when the temperature is not below 75 degrees Fahrenheit to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Sudden changes in temperature may kill the mantis. If kept warmer praying mantises will grow faster and live a shorter life but if kept cooler then they grow slower and live a longer life. When kept warmer it speeds up their metabolism and when kept cooler it slows down their metabolism and this is true for all praying mantises. To molt ""Deroplatys lobata"" need a rough superior support, like a piece of rough bark or a rough stick at a diagonal angle or attached to the top of the container so that the nymph will hang upside down which is needed to molt. Their cage should be well ventilated with twigs for the mantis to perch on. They don\'t require much room as they are not active predators, but they do need room to molt. A good sized container for ""Deroplatys lobata"" in width and height is usually 3x the length of the mantis, but for young nymphs (1st to 2nd instar nymphs) a 16oz container is good.

Now, however there are dozens of antidepressants on the market for the treatment of depression. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were the first drugs to be developed for the treatment of depression, dating back to the early 1950s. Because of their undesirable adverse-effect profile and high potential for toxicity, due to their non-selective pharmacological effects, strict regiments were for taking the drugs which limited their use. Because of this, researchers looked for other alternatives with similar effectiveness but fewer adverse effects e.g. drugs that did not cause cardiac conduction abnormalities in overdoses or had the tendency to cause seizures, which led to the discovery of the SSRI drugs. The SSRIs are the most significant class of antidepressants marketed in recent years and make one of the major medicinal discoveries of the last few decades. SSRIs were the first drugs to establish beyond doubt a pathophysiological role for 5-HT in affective illnesses and in the broad spectrum of anxiety disorders. Likewise, they were the first to confirm the inhibition of neurotransmitter re-uptake as an important therapeutic principle. The SSRIs are the first rationally designed class of psychotropic medications. The strategy behind rational drug design is to develop a new drug that is capable of affecting a specific biological target, or in this case a special neural site of action (uptake pumps, receptors), while trying to avoid effects on other site of actions. The goal in such development is to produce pharmacological agents that are more efficacious, safer and better tolerated than older medications. An initial success was achieved when medicinal chemists set out in search of the ideal SSRI with the chemical synthesis of zimelidine (figure 1) from the antihistamine drug brompheniramine, which exhibited selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake with minimal inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake. Most importantly, zimelidine did not come with the adverse effect profile as the TCAs and therefore it became the template for the second generation SSRIs. Zimelidine was the first SSRI to be marketed, but several cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome were associated with the use of the drug which led to withdrawal from the market in 1983. Subsequently, several non-tricyclic SSRIs were discovered and marketed. Fluoxetine, which was FDA approved in 1987 and is usually thought to be the first SSRI to be marketed, paved the way for the next generation of SSRIs and was thought to be some kind of prototype. Introduction of fluoxetine to the market is hailed as a miracle drug for the treatment of depression because it had fewer adverse effects, simpler dosing strategies and greater margin of safety when overdoses were consumed and thus it had better adherence, compared to the older antidepressants (TCAs and MAOIs). Since then the number of drugs in the SSRI class has become bigger and they are now six (fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluvoxamine), as demonstrated in table 1.'}]","[{'answer': 'The first drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression was Prozac, which was approved in 1987 [1].', 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1, 'sentences': [{'text': 'The first drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression was Prozac, which was approved in 1987 [1].', 'index': 0, 'answer_type': 'long', 'informative': 1, 'attributable': 1}]}, {'answer': 'The first drug approved by the FDA to treat clinical depression was Prozac.

Can a needlestick injury be fatal?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '3160300#2', 'text': 'Needlestick injuries are a common event in the healthcare environment. When drawing blood, administering an intramuscular or intravenous drug, or performing any procedure involving sharps, accidents can occur and facilitate the transmission of blood-borne diseases. Injuries also commonly occur during needle recapping or via improper disposal of devices into an overfilled or poorly located sharps container. Lack of access to appropriate personal protective equipment, or alternatively, employee failure to use provided equipment, increases the risk of occupational needlestick injuries. Needlestick injuries may also occur when needles are exchanged between personnel, loaded into a needle driver, or when sutures are tied off while still connected to the needle. Needlestick injuries are more common during night shifts and for less experienced people; fatigue, high workload, shift work, high pressure, or high perception of risk can all increase the chances of a needlestick injury. During surgery, a surgical needle or other sharp instrument may inadvertently penetrate the glove and skin of operating room personnel; scalpel injuries tend to be larger than a needlestick.

Does Hashimoto's attack the thyroid?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '660960#0', 'text': ""Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed. Early on there may be no symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goiter. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and anti-thyroid autoantibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves’ disease and nontoxic nodular goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is typically treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goiter. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis affects about 5% of the population at some point in their life. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50 and is much more common in women than men. Rates of disease appear to be increasing. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912.

What's a precedent in the SCOTUS?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '34293405#22', 'text': 'Scotus gave the lecture, ""Lectura"" I 39, during 1297–1299 to refute the view that everything is necessary and immutable. He claims that the aim of this lecture has two points (""Lectura"" I 39, §31): first, to consider the contingency in what is (""de contingentia in entibus""); second, to consider how God\'s certain knowledge is compatible with the contingency of things. Scotus tries to defend the validity of Christian theology against the attack of ancient philosophers. The main argument is unpacked in ""Lectura"" I 39, §§49–53. Scotus argues that a necessary being (God) is able to have contingent knowledge, and that although this knowledge is contingent, it is not necessarily mutable and temporal by that very fact.  In ""Lectura"" I 39 §1, Scotus asks, ""whether God has determinate knowledge of things according to every aspect of their existence, as according to being in the future."" He presents a counterview which claims that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. To support this counterview, Aristotle\'s ""De Interpretatione"" IX. In the following arguments, Scotus does not attempt to contradict Aristotle. He does not affirm or reject the ideas of Aristotle. The only issue he argues against is the proposition that God cannot have determinate knowledge of the future. Scotus appears to try to fully demonstrate that Aristotle\'s text is not contradictory to the Christian doctrine of God. Scotus argues that God wills with one single volition (""unica volitione"") whatever he wills. God has one volition ""ad intra"", but this one volition can be related to many opposite things ""ad extra"". God can simultaneously will one thing at time 1 and the opposite thing at time 2. There are various possible interpretations of Aristotle\'s ""De Interpretatione"" IX. For example, John Buridan (ca. 1300–1362) thought the Scotistic contingency theory was an Aristotelian view. Buridan\'s judgment is all the more possible because of at least four reasons: (1) Aristotle\'s ""De Interpretatione"" IX, 19a23-25 can be interpreted like the Scotistic contingency theory; (2) Scotus himself does not refute Aristotle\'s ""De Interpretatione"" IX in ""Lectura"" I 39 §§49–53; (3) Scotus, rather, tries to formulate his contingency theory with the help of other works of Aristotle in ""Lectura"" I 39 §§51, 54; (4) Scotus introduces the diachronic feature of God\'s volition to his contingency theory as well as the synchronic feature.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '2784530#26', 'text': 'On June 2, 1986, the defense requested for the case to move back to Puerto Rico, where the political motives would be understood and argued that the Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution offered a right to be tried in the district of offense and cited SCOTUS precedents of defendants being tried in their own community.

Where did Columbus land in his first voyage?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '29888040#10', 'text': 'The navigator Christopher Columbus, with the economic backing of the Catholic Monarchs, first reached the shores of the New World on 12 October 1492, initially believing that he had reached India. This voyage was carried out to expand markets by establishing new trade routes and therefore rival the Portuguese Empire, which was already well established in Asia. Following the success of that first voyage to the New World, others were organised with the intention of exploring and creating new trade routes. On his fourth voyage, Columbus, in 1502, met an unexpected storm and was forced to temporarily land on 15 August on the Bay Islands. In their first explorations of the area, Columbus\' group came upon a boat of Mayan origin travelling from the Yucatán Peninsula. The Spaniards were surprised by the large size of the vessel. Columbus detained the vessel and examined the cargo, which contained cocoa beans that he called ""almonds"" in his diary. However, he did not attach importance to these, and after this original inspection he let the boat proceed with its cargo.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '5635#18', 'text': 'Though Columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated Europe from the Far East and about the distance that each degree represented, he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds, which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the Atlantic Ocean.

The precise first land sighting and landing point was San Salvador Island. To return to Spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique, called beating, during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted.'}, {'idx': 3, 'docid': '28836767#1', 'text': 'On his first voyage, Christopher Columbus had mostly amicable encounters with the Taínos, one of the indigenous people of the Caribbean islands. He sailed along the islands\' coast, entering into capes and harbors to look at the scenery, hoping to find cities and large groups of population to trade with. Ultimately, what he expected was to reach the outer limits of the Chinese empire. Because he never found what he was looking for, he rarely went onto the land, but rather stayed on board his ship ""Santa María"". He saw several fires and canoes that showed Indians lived nearby, but they would all run and hide whenever Columbus’ ship came close. He continued traveling south along the coast, naming the different harbors and capes and trying to find Indians that would trade with him. On a few occasions Columbus did send men to explore the land. He even ventured onto the shore a couple times himself to see what the villages looked like. On these few occasions, Columbus did meet with some of the natives and, after their fear of the Spaniards subsided, they traded with the sailors. Columbus also inquired about the surrounding area and islands. Columbus described in his log the land as being exceedingly beautiful with lush forests and deep waters. He painted a picture of the natives as both a strong and meek people. They all walked around naked without any shame and ranged from dark tan to white in color.

Upon Columbus\'s return from his first voyage to the Americas, his first landing was made in the Portuguese Azores; a subsequent storm drove his ship to Lisbon on 4 March 1493. Hearing of Columbus\'s discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas. The treaty had been ratified with the 1481 papal bull ""Aeterni regis"", which confirmed previous bulls of 1452 (""Dum diversas""), 1455 (""Romanus Pontifex""), and 1456 (""Inter caetera""), recognizing Portuguese territorial claims along the West African coast.

When was the first power amplifier created?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '92791#3', 'text': 'The audio amplifier was invented around 1912 by Lee De Forest, made possible by his invention of the first practical amplifying electrical component, the triode vacuum tube (or ""valve"" in British English) in 1907. The triode was a three terminal device with a control grid that can modulate the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate. The triode vacuum amplifier was used to make the first AM radio. Early audio power amplifiers were based on vacuum tubes and some of these achieved notably high audio quality (e.g., the Williamson amplifier of 1947-9). Audio power amplifiers based on transistors became practical with the wide availability of inexpensive transistors in the late 1960s. Since the 1970s, most modern audio amplifiers are based on solid state devices (transistors such as BJTs, FETs and MOSFETs). Transistor-based amplifiers are lighter in weight, more reliable and require less maintenance than tube amplifiers. In the 2010s, there are still audio enthusiasts, musicians (particularly electric guitarists, electric bassists, Hammond organ players and Fender Rhodes electric piano players, among others), audio engineers and music producers who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and what is perceived as a ""warmer"" tube sound. Key design parameters for audio power amplifiers are frequency response, gain, noise, and distortion. These are interdependent; increasing gain often leads to undesirable increases in noise and distortion. While negative feedback actually reduces the gain, it also reduces distortion. Most audio amplifiers are linear amplifiers operating in class AB.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '9931#1', 'text': 'An amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. Amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in different ways.

For example, audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20\xa0kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20\xa0kHz and 300\xa0GHz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.

The non-SI kilogram-force is also a unit of force typically used in the measure of weight.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the UK used three different systems for mass and weight. The distinction between mass and weight is not always clearly drawn. Strictly a pound is a unit of mass, although it is commonly referred to as a weight. When a distinction is necessary, the term ""pound-force"" may be used to refer to a unit of force rather than mass. The troy pound () was made the primary unit of mass by the 1824 Act; however, its use was abolished in the UK on 1 January 1879, with only the troy ounce () and its decimal subdivisions retained.

Is common law the most common legal system in the world?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '75358#13', 'text': 'The two major legal traditions of the western world are the civil law courts and the common law courts. These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture although there are significant differences between the two traditions. Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman Law, specifically a civil body of law entitled ""Corpus iuris civilis"". This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Spain and subsequently being taught throughout continental European Universities. Civil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems. Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King\'s Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066. The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions. This common standard of law became known as ""Common Law"". This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems. In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an inquisitorial system. In the common law system, most courts follow the adversarial system. Procedural law governs the rules by which courts operate: civil procedure for private disputes (for example); and criminal procedure for violation of the criminal law.

Andropov was in a good position to take over the control of the party apparatus; three big system hierarchs, Brezhnev, Kosygin and Suslov had all died. A fourth, Kirilenko, was forced into retirement. At the Central Committee meeting of 22 November 1982, Kirilenko lost his membership in the Politburo (after a decision within the Politburo itself), and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee, was elected to the Secretariat. Ryzhkov became the Head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee, and became the leading Central Committee member on matters regarding economic planning. Shortly afterwards, Ryzhkov, after replacing Vladimir Dolgikh, began to oversee the civilian economy. At the 14–15 June 1983 Central Committee meeting, Vitaly Vorotnikov was elected as a candidate member of the Politburo, Grigory Romanov was elected to the Secretariat and five members of the Central Committee were given full membership. The election of Romanov in the Secretariat, weakened Chernenko's control considerably. Later, Yegor Ligachev was appointed as Head of the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee. Certain Brezhnev appointees were kept, such as Viktor Chebrikov and Nikolai Savinkin. With these appointments, Andropov effectively wielded the powers of the nomenklatura. Even so, by the time he had succeeded in dominating the Central Committee, Andropov fell ill. He was unable to attend the annual parade celebrating the victory of the October Revolution. Chernenko, the official second-ranking secretary, competed for power with Mikhail Gorbachev. The meetings of the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were postponed to the last possible moment because of Andropov's health. Changes continued however, and the Andropov appointees continued Andropov's course of introducing new blood into the Central Committee and Party apparatus. Vorotnikov and Mikhail Solomentsev were given full membership in the Politburo, Chebrikov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and Ligachev became a member of the Secretariat.

Why is Menopause important?,"[{'idx': 1, 'docid': '49611#54', 'text': 'The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.

An abnormally long or abnormally short QT interval is associated with an increased risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. Abnormalities in the QT interval can be caused by genetic conditions such as Long QT syndrome, by certain medications such as sotalol, by disturbances in the concentrations of certain salts within the blood such as hypokalaemia, or by hormonal imbalances such as hypothyroidism.'}, {'idx': 3, 'docid': '363747#0', 'text': 'Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition which affects repolarization of the heart after a heartbeat. This results in an increased risk of an irregular heartbeat which can result in palpitations, fainting, drowning, or sudden death. These episodes can be triggered by exercise or stress. Other associated symptoms may include hearing loss. Long QT syndrome may be present at birth or develop later in life. The inherited form may occur by itself or as part of larger genetic disorder. Onset later in life may result from certain medications, low blood potassium, low blood calcium, or heart failure. Medications that are implicated include certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, and antipsychotics. Diagnosis is based on an electrocardiogram (EKG) finding a corrected QT interval of greater than 440 to 500 milliseconds together with clinical findings. Management may include avoiding strenuous exercise, getting sufficient potassium in the diet, the use of beta blockers, or an implantable cardiac defibrillator. For people with LQTS who survive cardiac arrest and remain untreated, the risk of death within 15 years is greater than 50%. With proper treatment this decreases to less than 1% over 20 years. Long QT syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 7,000 people. Females are affected more often than males. Most people with the condition develop symptoms before they are 40 years old. It is a relatively common cause of sudden death along with Brugada syndrome and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. In the United States it results in about 3,500 deaths a year. The condition was first clearly described in 1957. Many people with long QT syndrome have no signs or symptoms. Symptoms that do occur are generally caused by abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias, most commonly a form of ventricular tachycardia called Torsades de pointes. If the arrhythmia reverts to a normal rhythm by itself then the affected person may experience a faint known as syncope. These faints may be associated with seizures.

Because of the ways in which light propagates through three-dimensional space — spreading out, becoming concentrated, reflecting off shiny or matte surfaces — and because light consists of many different wavelengths, the number of fundamentally different kinds of light measurement that can be made is large, and so are the numbers of quantities and units that represent them.'}]","[{'answer': 'The unit of measurement for light brightness is lumens [1].

I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself"" [1]. This perspective suggests that greed, when tempered with self-awareness and a balanced approach, can contribute positively to one's sense of well-being and personal satisfaction.

Boesky's statement is supported by the idea that greed, in its various forms – be it for life, money, love, or knowledge – can serve as a driving force that propels individuals towards success and achievement. This concept is exemplified in the 1987 film ""Wall Street,"" where the character Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, espouses the virtues of greed as a motivating force in life [2]. Gekko's character captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit, where individuals strive to succeed and advance in their respective fields due to their innate desire for success and personal gain.

However, it is essential to recognize that excessive greed, driven by an insatiable desire for wealth or power, can lead to detrimental consequences for oneself and others. In such cases, greed becomes a negative force that can hinder personal growth, damage relationships, and contribute to societal issues. Therefore, while greed can be a good thing in moderation and when tempered with self-awareness and a balanced perspective, it is crucial to be mindful of the potential pitfalls of unchecked greed.

In conclusion, greed can be a good thing when it is tempered by self-awareness, a balanced perspective, and a healthy approach to personal growth and achievement. As Ivan Boesky and the character Gordon Gekko in the film ""Wall Street"" illustrate, greed can serve as a motivating force that drives individuals towards success and personal fulfillment. However, it is essential to be mindful of the potential pitfalls of excessive greed and strive for a balance between personal ambition and ethical considerations."

These supermountains would have eroded, and the mass amounts of nutrients, including iron and phosphorus, would have washed into oceans, just as we see happening today.

There is an apparent direct relationship between orogeny and the atmospheric oxygen content).

In the early Qing dynasty, Han officials serving in the imperial court were required to learn the Manchu language, but most Manchus eventually learned to speak Chinese. The Manchus adopted Beijing Mandarin as their spoken language and this was a feature of Manchu Banner garrisons in areas of southern China. In 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, who could not understand officials from southern China, decreed that all takers of the civil service examination must be able to speak Beijing Mandarin. Though the decree was eventually lifted under the Jiaqing Emperor, the Beijing dialect spread first among officials and then among commoners under subsequent regimes. Shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation made the Beijing dialect the national standard for spoken Chinese in 1913. After the capital was moved to Nanjing, National Languages Committee reaffirmed the Beijing dialect as the standard in 1932. The People's Republic of China followed suit in 1955.\nThe Qing dynasty maintained a relatively stable supply of food for the population of the capital during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The government's grain tribute system brought food from the provinces and kept grain prices stable. Soup kitchens provided relief to the needy. The secure food supply helped the Qing court maintain a degree of political stability. Temple fairs such as the Huguo Fair, which are like monthly bazaars held around temples, added to the commercial vibrance of the city. At the height of the Qianlong Emperor's reign in 1781, the city had a population of 776,242 (and another 2.18 million in the surrounding region). Thereafter, Qing authorities began to restrict inward migration to the city.

What kind of needles are used for knitting?,"[{'idx': 0, 'docid': '16622#60', 'text': 'The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting. Circular needles may be used for flat or circular knitting.\nCable needles are a specific design, and are used to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths. When in use, the cable needle is used at the same time as two regular needles. It functions by holding together the stitches creating the cable as the other needles create the rest of the stitches for the knitted piece. At specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.'}, {'idx': 1, 'docid': '16622#57', 'text': 'There are three basic types of knitting needles (also called ""knitting pins""). The first and most common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob at the other end to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 to 25\xa0mm (roughly 1\xa0inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge/tension of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. Thus, a simple way to change gauge/tension is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. Although the diameter of the knitting needle is often measured in millimeters, there are several measurement systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given at knitting needle. Such knitting needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo offer more friction and are therefore less prone to dropping stitches. The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends. Needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.\nThe second type of knitting needles are straight, double-pointed knitting needles (also called ""DPNs""). Double-pointed needles are tapered at both ends, which allows them to be knit from either end. DPNs are typically used for circular knitting, especially smaller tube-shaped pieces such as sleeves, collars, and socks; usually one needle is active while the others hold the remaining active stitches. DPNs are somewhat shorter (typically 7 inches) and are usually sold in sets of four or five.\nCable needles are a special case of DPNs, although they are usually not straight, but dimpled in the middle. Often, they have the form of a hook. When cabling a knitted piece, a hook is easier to grab and hold the yarn. Cable needles are typically very short (a few inches), and are used to hold stitches temporarily while others are being knitted. Cable patterns are made by permuting the order of stitches; although one or two stitches may be held by hand or knit out of order, cables of three or more generally require a cable needle.'}, {'idx': 2, 'docid': '172056#1', 'text': 'The size of a needle is described first by its diameter and secondly by its length. The size of the new stitch is determined in large part by the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles. In most cases, the knitting needles being used in hand-knitting are of the same diameter; however, in uneven knitting, needles of different sizes may be used. Larger stitches may also be made by wrapping the yarn more than once around the needles with every stitch. The length of a needle determines how many stitches it can hold at once; for example, very large projects such as a shawl with hundreds of stitches might require a longer needle than a small project such as a scarf or bootie. Various sizing systems for needles are in common use.'}, {'idx': 3, 'docid': '15236565#49', 'text': 'The third needle type consists of circular needles, which are long, flexible double-pointed needles. The two tapered ends (typically long) are rigid and straight, allowing for easy knitting; however, the two ends are connected by a flexible strand (usually nylon) that allows the two ends to be brought together. Circular needles are typically 24-60\xa0inches long, and are usually used singly or in pairs; again, the width of the knitted piece may be significantly longer than the length of the circular needle. Special kits are available that allow circular needles of various lengths and diameters to be made as needed; rigid ends of various diameters may be screwed into strands of various lengths. The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.

The long shaft ""holds"" the active (unsecured) stitches of the fabric, to prevent them from unravelling, whereas the tapered ends are used to ""form new stitches"". Most commonly, a new stitch is formed by inserting the tapered end through an active stitch, catching a loop (also called a bight) of fresh yarn and drawing it through the stitch; this secures the initial stitch and forms a new active stitch in its place.

In territories acquired during the periods of ""de facto"" noble rule, serfdom was not abolished, and there was also a trend to set up respective estates in Sweden proper. The Great Reduction of 1680 put an end to these efforts of the nobility and required them to return estates once gained from the crown to the king.

But the ""Vasa"" did not pass its maiden voyage and sunk in 1628, leaving Sweden without its most powerful vessel and causing financial problems within the naval ministry. No expenses had been spared decorating the warship, and many tonnes of gold and bronze statues were now very difficult to salvage. Instead of relying on a naval power of his own, Gustavus sought to ally with the dominant Protestant naval powers in Europe (namely England and the Dutch Republic).

Infections are categorized based on the part of the body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.\nThere are two types of herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more commonly causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital herpes is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital herpes is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting herpes DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.\nThe most effective method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk. Daily antiviral medication taken by someone who has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine may be used to help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of symptomatic episodes.\nWorldwide rates of either HSV-1 or HSV-2 are between 60% and 95% in adults. HSV-1 is usually acquired during childhood. Rates of both increase as people age. Rates of HSV-1 are between 70% and 80% in populations of low socioeconomic status and 40% to 60% in populations of improved socioeconomic status. An estimated 536 million people worldwide (16% of the population) were infected with HSV-2 as of 2003 with greater rates among women and those in the developing world.

Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than ""vice versa"".

What language root is Tamil?,"[{'idx': 0, 'docid': '7816896#0', 'text': 'Tamil-Brahmi, or Tamili aka Tamizhi is a variant of the Brahmi script used to write the Tamil language. These are the earliest documents of a Dravidian language, and the script was well established in the Chera and Pandyan states, in what is now Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Sri Lanka. Inscriptions have been found on cave beds, pot sherds, Jar burials, coins, seals, and rings. The language is Archaic Tamil, and led to classical Sangam literature.'}, {'idx': 1, 'docid': '293133#38', 'text': 'Tamil, one of India\'s major classical language, descends from Proto-Dravidian languages spoken around the third millennium BCE in peninsular India. The earliest inscriptions of Tamil have been found on pottery dating back to 500 BC. Tamil literature has existed for over two thousand years and the earliest epigraphic records found date from around the 3rd century BCE.\nThe evolution of language within India may be distinguished over three periods: old, middle and modern Indo-Aryan. The classical form of old Indo-Aryan was ""sanskrit"" meaning polished, cultivated and correct, in distinction to ""Prakrit"" – the practical language of the migrating masses evolving without concern to proper pronunciation or grammar, the structure of language changing as those masses mingled, settled new lands and adopted words from people of other native languages. ""Prakrita"" became middle Indo-Aryan leading to ""Pali"" (the language of early Buddhists and Ashoka era in 200–300 BCE), ""Prakrit"" (the language of Jain philosophers) and ""Apabhramsa"" (the language blend at the final stage of middle Indo-Aryan). It is ""Apabhramsa"", scholars claim, that flowered into Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi and many other languages now in use in India\'s north, east and west. All of these Indian languages have roots and structure similar to Sanskrit, to each other and to other Indo-European languages. Thus we have in India three thousand years of continuous linguistic history recorded and preserved in literary documents. This enables scholars to follow language evolution and observe how, by changes hardly noticeable from generation to generation, an original language alters into descendant languages that are now barely recognisable as the same.\nSanskrit has had a profound impact on the languages and literature of India. Hindi, India\'s most spoken language, is a ""Sanskritised register"" of the Khariboli dialect. In addition, all modern Indo-Aryan languages, Munda languages and Dravidian languages, have borrowed many words either directly from Sanskrit (""tatsama"" words), or indirectly via middle Indo-Aryan languages (""tadbhava"" words). Words originating in Sanskrit are estimated to constitute roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages, and the literary forms of (Dravidian) Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada.

Since the 1960s, South Korea became one of East Asia's fastest growing economies achieving a rapid increase in its GDP per capita more quickly than any of its neighbors.

Transforming itself from a resource-poor peninsula to an advanced high technology powerhouse with a cutting-edge electronic, automobiles, shipbuilding, steel, and petrochemicals industry contributed to the country's robust and sustained economic growth for over 50 years. Capital investments in research and development are among the highest in the world relative to its national income.

When was the first home TV introduced?,"[{'idx': 0, 'docid': '29831#1', 'text': 'Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers.

During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax, VHS tape, local disks, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule. For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p.

It contains the following tracks:Composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the production of ""Cats"" is based on T. S. Eliot\'s ""Old Possum\'s Book of Practical Cats"" (1939), which the composer recalled as having been a childhood favorite. The songs of the musical comprise Eliot\'s verse set to music by the composer, the principal exception being the most famous song from the musical, ""Memory"", for which the lyrics were written by Trevor Nunn after an Eliot poem entitled ""Rhapsody on a Windy Night"". Also, a brief song entitled ""The Moments of Happiness"" was taken from a passage in Eliot\'s Four Quartets. Lloyd Webber began composing the songs in late 1977 and premiered the compositions at the Sydmonton Festival in 1980. The concert was attended by T .S. Eliot\'s wife, Valerie Eliot and she loved the songs that Lloyd Webber had composed. She gave her blessing for the songs to be adapted into a musical stage play. Rehearsals for the musical began in early 1981 at the New London Theatre. Due to the Eliot estate asserting that they write no script and only use the original poems as the text, the musical had no identified plot during the rehearsal process, causing many actors to be confused about what they were actually doing. An unusual musical in terms of its construction, the overture incorporates a fugue and there are occasions when the music accompanies spoken verse. The show is completely told through music with virtually no spoken dialogue in between the songs.

The set, consisting of an oversized junkyard, remains the same throughout the show without any scene changes.

To resolve this discrepancy, we can assume that the number of signers mentioned in context [2] (98) is the accurate count, as it does not include Juan O'Donoju, who was not a signer according to context [1].

The major body fluid which acts as the lifeline of the living organisms is ""Blood"". Blood is an extremely complex biological fluid. It consists of blood cells suspended in plasma and other different types of cells which include white blood cells, platelets etc. The blood flow in arteries and veins are closely linked to the blood vessel properties.\nCarrying the oxygen and nutrients to various tissues and organs of our body, delivering carbon dioxide to the lungs and accepting oxygen, bringing the metabolic by products to the kidneys, regulating the body\'s defence mechanism, that is, the immune system and facilitating an effective heat and mass transfer across the body are some of the major functions which blood performs in the human body.\nBlood consists of the red blood cells or erythrocytes, white blood cells or leukocytes, and platelets or thrombocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide are known as Erythrocytes. The cells which are involved primarily in phagocytosis (the process of destruction of unknown particulate matter) and immune responses are known as Leukocytes; thrombocytes are the components of blood which are involved in blood clotting. In addition to these 55 to 60 percent of blood by volume consists of plasma. Plasma is the transparent, amber-colored liquid in which the cellular components of blood are suspended. Plasma contains constituents such as proteins, electrolytes, hormones, and nutrients. The serum is blood plasma from which clotting factors have been removed.Blood accounts for 6 to 8 percent of body weight in normal, healthy humans. The density of blood is slightly greater than the density of water at approximately 1060\xa0 kg/m3. The increased density comes from the increased density of a red blood cell compared with the density of water or plasma. \nRheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter. Blood Rheology is the study of blood, especially the properties associated with the deformation and flow of blood. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid. However, often the non-Newtonian effect is very small due to various reasons. Thus, it is important to know about the blood rheology.\nOne of the characteristics of blood that affects the work required to cause the blood to flow through the arteries is the viscosity of blood. The viscosity of blood is in the range of 3 to 6 cP, or 0.003 to 0.006 Ns/m2. Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the viscosity of blood is not a constant with respect to the rate of shearing strain. In addition to the rate of shearing strain, the viscosity of blood is also dependent on temperature and on the volume percentage of blood that consists of red blood cells. If blood is made stationary for several seconds then clotting begins in the blood, as a result of which the viscosity of the blood increases. When the stationary state is disturbed with increasing shear rate, the clot formation is destroyed and the viscosity decreases. Moreover, the orientation of red blood cells present in the blood also affects the viscosity of blood. Thus, we can say that blood is a shear thinning fluid, i.e., viscosity decreases with increase in shear rate. Beyond a shear rate of about 100s^-1, the viscosity is nearly constant and the blood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. Blood is a viscoelastic material, i.e., viscous and elastic because the effective viscosity of blood not only depends on the shear rate but also on the history of shear rate.It is also important to note that the normal blood flows much more easily compared to rigid particles, for the same particle volume fraction. This is due to the fact that red blood cells can accommodate by deforming in order to pass by one another.', 'title': 'Biofluid dynamics'}, {'docid': '67158#2', 'text': ""In humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults.
