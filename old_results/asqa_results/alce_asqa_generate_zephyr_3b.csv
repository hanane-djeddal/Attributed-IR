It stars Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise, two friends who embark on a road trip that ends up in unforeseen circumstances. Louise, played by Susan Sarandon, killed a man in the movie in a fit of rage.","In the film ""Thelma & Louise,"" there are two primary suspects in the murder of the man, Herb Strom, who are Carl Denham and Sheriff J.P. Harrah. Carl Denham is a wealthy land developer who becomes romantically involved with Thelma, while Sheriff J.P. Harrah is a local lawman who tries to protect the town and its residents.

The murder takes place at the climax of the film, which is directed by Ridley Scott and based on the novel ""Thelma & Louise"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story revolves around two young women, Thelma (played by Brooke Adams) and Louise (played by Sally Hurst), who embark on a road trip across the American Southwest.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Herb Strom, a man with a dark past and a connection to both Thelma and Louise, is murdered. The motive behind the murder is not explicitly stated in the film, but it is suggested that Strom may have been involved in some illicit activities or had a history of violence.

Carl Denham and Sheriff J.P. Harrah are both implicated in the murder, with various clues pointing to their involvement. Carl Denham, who is romantically linked to Thelma, has a history of violence and manipulation. He is seen arguing with Thelma and Louise earlier in the film, and it is suggested that he may have killed Herb Strom to protect his relationship with Thelma.

Sheriff J.P. Harrah, on the other hand, is a lawman who is trying to maintain the peace in the town. He is shown to be investigating the murder and has a close relationship with Thelma. However, it is revealed that Harrah had a history of violence and had previously been involved in a criminal underworld. It is suggested that he may have killed Herb Strom to protect the town and its residents from the potential fallout of Strom's death.

In the film's final scene, both Carl Denham and Sheriff J.P. Harrah are seen running away from the crime scene, with the implication being that they conspired to kill Herb Strom together. The truth behind the murder remains ambiguous, leaving the interpretation up to the viewer's interpretation."

The poem itself is divided up into three separate sections: the first part (ll. 1–27), the second part (ll. 28–121) and the third part (ll. 122–156). In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood. In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus\' death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J.

Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts.

","The Battle of Philippi was fought during the Second Bulgarian Uprising against Ottoman rule in May 1345. Although it is often mistakenly referred to as a part of the Bulgarian-Ottoman conflict, it was primarily fought between the forces of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan II and the Ottoman Empire.

Ivan II's forces emerged victorious from the Battle of Philippi. The Bulgarian army, led by their experienced commander Helya Rakimovich, managed to hold their ground against the Ottoman forces led by Sultan Murad I's general, Lala Mustafa Pasha. The battle took place near the town of Philippi (now Sofia, the capital of modern-day Bulgaria) and resulted in a decisive victory for the Bulgarians.

The battle was significant for several reasons. Firstly, it marked the beginning of the end for the Second Bulgarian Uprising, which had begun in 1331. The uprising aimed to liberate Bulgaria from Ottoman rule and restore it to its former status as an independent Bulgarian principality. The Battle of Philippi, however, dashed these ambitions.

Secondly, the battle was a turning point in the Ottoman-Bulgarian conflict, as it led to the eventual capture and execution of Ivan II in January 1346. The Ottomans sought to punish the Bulgarian Tsar for his defiance and to weaken the Bulgarian resistance.

In conclusion, the Battle of Philippi was a significant victory for the Bulgarian forces under the command of Tsar Ivan II, who managed to halt the Ottoman expansion into Bulgarian territory and effectively ended the Second Bulgarian Uprising."

"[{'context': 'The central nervous system has two distinct ways of controlling the force produced by a muscle through motor unit recruitment: spatial recruitment and temporal recruitment. Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force. Larger motor units contract along with small motor units until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches ""fuse"" temporally.

The question is asking about the muscle fibers that are controlled by a single motor axon.

Step 2: Recall relevant information
Motor neurons are specialized neurons that control muscle contractions. They have an axon that carries electrical signals (action potentials) to muscle fibers, which are the basic units of muscles.

Step 3: Determine the specific type of muscle fibers
The question specifically asks about muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon. This implies that we are discussing the type of muscle fibers that are activated by a single motor neuron.

Step 4: Answer the question
Based on the information recalled, the muscle fibers under the control of a single motor axon are called ""single motor fiber"" or ""type I"" muscle fibers. These are the slow-contracting muscle fibers that are best suited for activities requiring prolonged, low-intensity efforts, such as maintaining posture or long-duration activities."

According to O'Brien, he tells Winston that The Book was written by a committee that included himself.","The theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism was largely developed by Antonio Gramsci, an Italian Marxist philosopher and political scientist. He proposed this concept as a form of governance in his influential work, ""Pentapoli,"" published in 1922, and later in his broader work, ""The Prison Notes,"" written during his imprisonment between 1922 and 1924. Gramsci's ideas explore the role of the bourgeoisie in a capitalist society and how they establish a system of control through the manipulation of various social and political institutions, ultimately leading to an oligarchical form of collectivism."

The concept of the haves and have nots can be traced back to various historical periods and social movements.

One of the earliest instances of the haves and have nots can be traced back to the medieval period in Europe, where the wealth and power were predominantly held by the Church and the nobility. The common people, who made up the majority of the population, often struggled to access basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter.

During the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries, the concept of the haves and have nots evolved as the economy shifted from agrarian-based to industrialized. The rapid growth of factories and urbanization led to the emergence of a new class of wealthy industrialists, while the working class, predominantly composed of men, experienced significant improvements in living standards but still faced challenges in accessing education, healthcare, and other essential services.

The term ""haves and have nots"" gained prominence during the early 20th century with the emergence of Marxist thought and the socialist movement. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels introduced the concept in their influential work, ""The Communist Manifesto"" (1848), which argued that the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class) was the root cause of social inequality and poverty.

In the mid-20th century, the concept of the haves and have nots became more explicitly associated with the term ""poverty trap,"" which refers to the situation where individuals or communities are trapped in poverty due to lack of access to resources and opportunities. The poverty trap has been a significant issue in many developing countries, where economic growth has not led to equitable distribution of wealth and resources, exacerbating income inequality and poverty.

In summary, the concept of the haves and have nots can be traced back to historical periods like medieval Europe and the early 20th century with the emergence of Marxist thought. The modern understanding of the haves and have nots as a social phenomenon has been shaped by the growing awareness of economic inequality and the poverty trap in contemporary societies."

"[{'context': 'An initial burst of effervescence occurs when the Champagne contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate nucleation or, to a minimal extent, on cellulose fibres left over from the wiping/drying process as shown with a high-speed video camera.

The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer.

""Plane crash Grey's Anatomy"" seems to refer to a specific event that occurred during the filming of Grey's Anatomy, a popular TV show. On May 11, 2019, a plane crash occurred near Santa Monica, California, which resulted in the tragic loss of life, including that of actress and producer, Fallon Goodboy, who played a character on Grey's Anatomy.

However, the question does not specify whether it is referring to the plane crash incident or the season of the TV show Grey's Anatomy. If you are asking about the season in which the plane crash incident occurred, the answer is that it happened during the filming of Season 17, which took place between October 5, 2017, and May 16, 2018.

If you are asking about the season in which the storyline involving the plane crash took place in the TV show Grey's Anatomy, the answer is that it occurred during Season 17, as mentioned above. The storyline revolved around the characters dealing with the aftermath of the tragic accident and its impact on their personal and professional lives."

The easier process to change lead to gold is neutron capture and beta decay, which is the process of one or more neutrons and a nucleus collide and merge to form a heavier nucleus.","To change a lead atom (Pb) into a gold atom (Au), several steps and conditions must be met to undergo a chemical transformation known as element substitution or element replacement. This process involves replacing one element with another in a compound or undergoing a nuclear reaction to form a new element.

1. Formation of a compound: First, a suitable compound must form between the lead and gold atoms. This could be achieved by combining lead with a metal or non-metal that has a higher atomic number than gold, such as silver (Ag). The resulting compound would be a mixture of lead and silver, with the possibility of some gold atoms present in trace amounts.

2. Reaction with a reducing agent: To facilitate the replacement of the lead atom, a reducing agent, such as sodium (Na), is often used. This is because lead atoms are more reactive when they are in the presence of a reducing agent, which helps lower the energy barrier for the reaction to occur.

3. Activation of gold atoms: Gold atoms are relatively inert and do not readily react with other elements under normal conditions. However, when exposed to a reducing agent, gold atoms can become more reactive due to the formation of gold(III) ions (Au(OH)3). These ions have a lower energy barrier and can react with other elements, including lead atoms.

4. Reaction with lead atoms: The gold(III) ions react with lead atoms in the compound, forming a gold-lead compound. This reaction involves the transfer of electrons from the gold(III) ions to the lead atom, which results in the formation of a new element with the desired gold atom.

5. Separation of the compound and the gold-lead compound: After the reaction has taken place, the original compound containing lead and silver would have been separated from the newly formed gold-lead compound. The purity of the gold-lead compound can be enhanced by repeating the process multiple times to ensure that all lead atoms have been replaced with gold atoms.

6. Extraction of gold: The final step involves extracting the gold from the gold-lead compound. This can be achieved through various methods, such as using a solvent to dissolve the compound and then purifying the gold-containing solution. The purified gold can then be further processed to obtain pure gold.

In summary, to change a lead atom into a gold atom, a suitable compound must be formed between lead and a metal or non-metal with a higher atomic number than gold. A reducing agent, such as sodium, is often used to activate the gold atoms and facilitate the reaction with lead atoms. The resulting gold-lead compound can then be separated from the original compound and further processed to obtain pure gold."

Salinger's novel ""Franny and Zooey,"" published in 1961. However, the exact origin of the phrase is unclear and there are multiple stories associated with its creation.

One popular story goes that Salinger himself, during a speech at a college, was asked if he had any advice for aspiring writers. In response, he said, ""If you can do it, somebody else can do it better."" This quote became famous and is often associated with the novel.

Another story claims that Salinger was inspired by a conversation he had with his sister, who told him that she had just finished a book that was much better than anything he had written. Salinger allegedly responded, ""If you can do it, anybody can do it.""

Regardless of its origin, the quote has since become a well-known phrase in literature and popular culture, often used to express the idea that if someone else can do something, there is no reason you couldn't do it better too."

As a student of Democritus, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus also believed atoms and the void comprised all of reality.","The philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) is often credited with the thought that atoms and the void comprised all of reality. In his famous phrase, ""Cogito, ergo sum"" (I think, therefore I am), Descartes was attempting to express the fundamental nature of human thought and its relationship to the external world. However, his belief system, known as Cartesian dualism, suggested that the ultimate reality of the world could be explained by two distinct substances: mind (or soul) and matter.

Descartes believed that the world we perceive through our senses is an illusion created by the mind, and that the true reality lies in the underlying physical world, which he referred to as ""mathematical physics."" He argued that this physical world is composed of indivisible, immutable, and eternal particles called atoms, which he believed were the building blocks of all matter. Descartes also posited that these atoms interact with one another through the void, which he called ""void space"" or ""emptiness."" In this void, there is no real existence of space or time, but rather a kind of infinite, all-encompassing emptiness that allows the particles to move and interact with one another.

Descartes' view of reality as consisting of atoms and void space was an influential concept in the development of modern atomic theory and the understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. However, it is essential to note that Descartes' ideas were part of a broader philosophical context, and his views on reality were not universally accepted during his lifetime. Over time, scientific advancements and new discoveries in the fields of physics and chemistry have led to a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of reality, which has challenged and expanded upon Descartes' ideas."

It refers to the period of relative peace and stability that the Roman Empire experienced after the end of the Punic Wars in 27 BC. The Pax Romana was established by the first Roman emperor, Augustus, and lasted for about 500 years until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.

The Pax Romana was important for several reasons:

1. Stability: The period of peace and stability allowed the Roman Empire to focus on internal affairs and expansion, leading to increased prosperity and economic growth.

2. Infrastructure: The peace allowed for the construction and expansion of roads, aqueducts, and other public works, which facilitated trade and communication throughout the empire.

3. Cultural and intellectual development: The period of peace provided a stable environment for the flourishing of arts, literature, and philosophy.

4. Military reforms: The Roman military was able to maintain its strength and effectiveness during this time, which contributed to the empire's overall security and stability.

5. Political consolidation: The Pax Romana allowed for the Roman Empire to establish its dominance over a vast territory and maintain its unity under a centralized government.

In summary, the Pax Romana was a significant period in Roman history that brought about stability, prosperity, and cultural development, which laid the foundation for the Roman Empire's continued growth and influence."

Taste buds are specialized sensory organs that enable us to perceive different tastes such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory). They are distributed unevenly along the tongue's surface, with the highest concentration found in two regions: the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the posterior one-third.

1. Taste Bud Clusters: These are groups of taste buds that are found in clusters near the front of the tongue. They are particularly sensitive to sweet and umami flavors. The taste bud clusters are located near the upper and middle part of the tongue, particularly in the central area.

2. Gustatory Papillae: These are small, finger-like projections that extend from the taste bud clusters and line the ridges of the tongue. They are responsible for detecting sour, bitter, and salty flavors. Gustatory papillae are most concentrated in the posterior two-thirds of the tongue, particularly in the back region.

"[{'context': 'On November 20, 2015, ""Jessica Jones"" was released on Netflix, with the title character portrayed by Krysten Ritter as an adult and by Elizabeth Cappuccino as a teenager. As a child, she was in a car accident that killed her parents and put her in a coma. After she regained consciousness, Jessica was legally adopted by talent agent Dorothy Walker, therefore becoming the adopted sister of Trish Walker. As an adult, Jessica crosses paths with Kilgrave and spends a year under his control, snapping out of it after she kills Luke Cage\'s wife Reva Connors on Kilgrave\'s orders. She experiences post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of what Kilgrave did to her, and drinks to excess to numb her pain and guilt. Her Jewel costume from the comics appears briefly in the fifth episode of season 1, ""AKA: The Sandwich Saved Me"", although she refuses to wear it and rejects Trish\'s suggestion of Jewel as an alias, saying ""Jewel is a stripper\'s name, a really slutty stripper. And if I wear that thing you\'re going to have to call me Camel Toe."" In the eighth episode of ""Iron Fist"", Joy Meachum indirectly mentions to her brother Ward that she hired Jessica in the past to take compromising pictures of members on the Rand Enterprises board of directors. Ritter reprised her role in ""The Defenders"", a 2017 crossover miniseries. A second season of ""Jessica Jones"" was released on Netflix on March 8, 2018, on International Women\'s Day.

In 1948, following the Arab–Israeli War, Israel declared its independence and gained control over the majority of the land that constitutes present-day Israel. The war resulted in Israel capturing territories that were majority Arab, including the cities of Jerusalem, Haifa, and Safed, as well as the West Bank and the Golan Heights. The Arab–Israeli War led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who became refugees in their own land.

The borders of Israel were later adjusted in the following years through the Israel–Egypt War (1948-1949) and the Israel–Lebanon War (2006).

The first helicopter model to carry a pilot was in 1907. Two French brothers, Jacques and Louis Breguet, built the ""Gyroplane No.1"" sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907. It lifted its pilot 2 ft into the air for about a minute. The Gyroplane No.1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady. On 13 November 1907, another French inventor, Paul Cornu, designed and built the Cornu helicopter. It lifted its inventor off the ground and remained aloft for 20 seconds. Even though this flight did not surpass in height the flight of the Gyroplane No. 1, it was reported to be the first truly free flight with a pilot as it did not need to be held steady. Almost three decades later, German aviation pioneer and co-founder of the Focke-Wulf company, invented the Fw 61. This was the world\'s first practical transverse twin-rotor helicopter. It first flew on 26 June 1936 to more than 8,000 feet (2,400 m) at speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h). A few years later, on 11 December 1951, turbine engines started being used in helicopters. This meant the helicopter could fly with a large amount of power and a low weight penalty.'}, {'knowledge': [], 'long_answer': 'There are a number of helicopters, including twin-rotor, turbine-powered, manned, and truly free helicopters.

His design, the Bloch B2, was initially intended for military use as a reconnaissance and transport vehicle. However, due to its unconventional design and lack of stability in flight, the B2 failed to meet expectations. It wasn't until Sikorsky refined and improved his design that the first successful helicopter flight took place with the Model DS-1, also known as the S-13. This new helicopter model was powered by a 40 horsepower gasoline engine and had a maximum speed of approximately 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour).

Igor Sikorsky's pioneering work laid the groundwork for the modern helicopter industry, and his contributions to aviation technology earned him the title of ""Father of the Helicopter."" The first successful helicopter flight marked the beginning of a new era in aviation, as it showcased the potential of rotorcraft as a versatile and efficient means of transportation, search and rescue, and military operations."

The East India Company was an English, and later British, joint-stock company founded in 1600 and was the means by which cricket was introduced into India.","The game of cricket in India can be traced back to the 17th century when it was introduced by British missionaries and soldiers during their interactions with Indian people, particularly in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The earliest known reference to cricket in India dates back to the 1730s when it was played by British soldiers stationed at Fort St. George in Chennai (then known as Madras).

Initially, cricket was played with a round leather ball and a hand-made bat made from tree branches. The British introduced the cricket ball, which was made from leather and had a stitched seam, and this led to the development of the modern bat and ball materials. The first cricket grounds in India were established during the 19th century, primarily in the British-ruled regions.

Over time, the game gained popularity among the Indian population, and by the mid-19th century, cricket had become a popular sport in the country. The first Indian-organized cricket club was formed in 1833 in Calcutta (now Kolkata), and the first inter-colonial cricket match between India and England took place in 1844 at the Madras Cricket Club Ground in Chennai.

In conclusion, cricket was initiated in India by the British during the 17th century through interactions with Indian people, particularly in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The game gained popularity over time, and by the mid-19th century, it had become a popular sport in the country."

Additionally, the plan proposed that the legislative branch would have the power to veto state laws if they were deemed incompatible with the articles of union, or the states were deemed incompetent.","The Virginia Plan, proposed by James Madison during the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, sought to reorganize the United States Constitution and give more power to the states. The Virginia Plan primarily aimed to emphasize the importance of state sovereignty and to ensure that the federal government would not become too powerful at the expense of the states.

In the Virginia Plan, the primary focus was on the legislative branch, specifically the Congress. The proposal suggested that the number of representatives each state would receive in the House of Representatives should be proportional to the number of free white males in each state. This meant that states with larger populations of free white males would have more representatives in Congress, thus giving them more influence over federal legislation.

Additionally, the Virginia Plan proposed that the Senate should be composed of two senators for each state, with the number of senators determined by the state's population. This would again give states with larger populations more influence in the Senate.

Furthermore, the Virginia Plan emphasized the importance of state conventions in the amendment process. These conventions would be called when the federal government attempted to pass laws that conflicted with the states' rights or when the federal government sought to impose taxes without the states' consent. In these situations, the states could propose amendments to the Constitution, which would then be sent to the federal government for ratification.

In summary, the Virginia Plan primarily gave more power to the states by emphasizing state sovereignty, proposing proportional representation in Congress based on population, and encouraging the use of state conventions for proposing and ratifying amendments to the Constitution."

Based on the information gathered in Step 2, I will now identify a person who has made significant contributions to the field of eye witness research.

Step 4: Provide the answer
A pioneer in the field of eye witness research is Dr. Stanley Milgram. He is a psychologist who developed the ""small-scale conditioning"" technique, which he used to investigate the influence of social context on memory. His work contributed significantly to the understanding of how memory can be influenced by situational factors and led to the development of the field of forensic psychology."

It was written by the prolific songwriting duo of Otis Redding and Steve Cropper, who were also known for their work with other prominent soul artists of that era, such as Art Upton and Bobby McClure.

Irma Thomas, born on February 18, 1941, in Ponchatoula, Louisiana, was a significant figure in the early years of New Orleans R&B and soul music. She began her music career in the early 1960s and gained prominence with her unique blend of soul, pop, and R&B music. Thomas' powerful, emotive vocals and her ability to convey deep emotions through her music resonated with listeners and contributed to her lasting legacy in the music industry.

""What Is Love, Baby, Don't Hurry Me Down"" was included in Thomas' debut album, ""This Is Love,"" released in 1964. The song became one of her signature hits, showcasing her soulful voice and Thomas' distinctive style. The song's lyrics express a longing for love and reassurance, with Thomas imploring her lover not to rush into a relationship and to take their time in getting to know each other better.

Over the years, ""What Is Love, Baby, Don't Hurry Me Down"" has been covered by numerous artists and has been featured in several films and television shows, further increasing its popularity and recognition. Some notable examples include its use in the 1983 film ""Hairspray"" and the 2000 television series ""Sister, Sister.""

In conclusion, the song ""What Is Love, Baby, Don't Hurry Me Down"" was originally performed by the talented soul singer Irma Thomas in 1964. The song, with its heartfelt lyrics and Thomas' powerful vocals, has since become an iconic piece of 1960s soul music and a testament to Thomas' enduring influence on the genre."

While the majority of the Sahara is indeed a desert, the region surrounding the Atlas Mountains in northern Morocco and the eastern part of the desert near the Tropic of Cancer experiences a semi-desert climate.

Desert climates are characterized by extremely low precipitation, often less than 250 millimeters per year, and high temperatures during the day, which can soar above 40°C (104°F). These climates are typically arid and feature sparse vegetation, with plants adapted to conserve water and withstand the harsh conditions.

On the other hand, semi-desert climates have slightly higher precipitation levels, typically ranging from 250 to 750 millimeters per year, compared to deserts. These climates still experience extreme temperatures, but the vegetation is more diverse and can support a wider range of plant life. Some common features of semi-desert climates include rocky terrain, occasional water sources, and a more diverse landscape than true deserts.

In summary, while the majority of the Sahara is a desert, the region surrounding the Atlas Mountains in northern Morocco and the eastern part of the desert near the Tropic of Cancer experiences semi-desert climates. These climates exhibit a mix of arid and slightly more hospitable conditions compared to the extreme heat and lack of water found in true deserts."

Mark Reynolds, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player, participated in the 2009 MLB Derby held at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. This Derby was his first and only appearance in the event.

During the Derby, players have a specific number of at-bats (usually 3 or 4) to hit as many home runs as possible. The competition was held over a period of 7 innings, with each player getting an at-bat per inning. In the case of Mark Reynolds, he had three at-bats during the 7 innings.

Despite his impressive performance in the 2009 Derby, Mark Reynolds' career in the MLB was not as successful as many expected. He was selected as the first overall pick in the 2005 MLB Draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks but struggled with consistency and injuries throughout his career. After playing for several teams, including the Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, and Philadelphia Phillies, he retired from professional baseball in 2018.

In conclusion, Mark Reynolds holds the record for the most home runs hit in a single edition of the Home Run Derby with 8 home runs, achieved during his debut in the 2009 MLB Derby."

This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum.",The group of cells that control the natural resting heart rate are found in the sinoatrial (SA) node in the heart. These cells are specialized pacemaker cells responsible for initiating and regulating the heart's rhythmic contractions.

This innovation allowed for the mass production of interlocking wooden veneers, which made plywood more affordable, durable, and versatile compared to alternative materials like leather, silk, and upholstered furniture. As a result, plywood quickly gained popularity in the furniture industry, especially for items like tables, chairs, and cabinets that required structural stability and easy manufacturing."

It was a small battle fought between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by General Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by General George G. Meade. The battle resulted in a Union victory.

Blackburn's Ford is located near the town of Coeburn, Virginia, and the battle occurred near the intersection of two small streams called Blackburn's Ford. The Union forces, led by Brigadier General Jesse Reno, successfully defended a position at the ford against a much larger Confederate force.

Although the battle was relatively brief and had little impact on the overall course of the war, it is significant for a few reasons:

1. It was one of the few battles in which a Union officer, Brigadier General Jesse Reno, achieved a notable victory against a larger Confederate force. Reno was later promoted to major general for his actions during the battle.

2. The Union forces managed to repel the Confederate attack, demonstrating their ability to hold ground against larger, better-equipped forces.

3. The battle took place near Washington, D.C., and was seen as a morale boost for the Union army, especially as they were defending the capital against potential Confederate invasion.

As a result of the battle, the Confederate forces retreated, and the Union forces maintained control of the area. The victory at Blackburn's Ford was one of several Union victories during the early stages of the Civil War, which eventually led to the Confederacy's defeat."

Melady was the last person to be publicly executed in Canada when he was hanged on December 7, 1869, on the outside wall of a jail located in Goderich, Ontario, for the murder of his father, Nicholas Melady Senior and his stepmother Ellen. The murders are believed to have been committed on the evening of June 6, 1868, on a farm in the present day municipality of Huron East, south of the current community of Seaforth, Ontario. Melady\'s trial was surrounded by controversy at the time, with allegations of perjury, lost and planted evidence, as well as the unusual use of a female police informant, who posed as a criminal and feigned affection for Melady while he was imprisoned, in an attempt to gain a confession from him. The informant, named in records as ""Jenny Smith"", was the wife of a local police officer. During the course of the investigation into the crime, seven other members of the Melady family, as well as two other male individuals, were initially jailed as suspects and later released. Melady\'s execution occurred several hours in advance of the officially announced time it was to occur in an attempt to avoid the civil disorder that sometimes accompanied public hangings. It is reported that a crowd of several thousand people were present at the jail at the originally announced time of the execution, many of whom are reported to have shouted their disapproval of the altered schedule of events.

The main causes of the split can be summarized as follows:

1. Theological differences: The Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have distinct doctrinal beliefs and practices. For example, the Roman Catholic Church emphasizes the authority of the Pope and the use of Latin in the Mass, while the Eastern Orthodox Church places more emphasis on the role of the bishop and the use of the Greek language in liturgy.

2. Political conflicts: The split was also influenced by political tensions between the two regions. The Roman Catholic Church was closely aligned with the Holy Roman Empire, while the Eastern Orthodox Church was more supportive of the Byzantine Empire. These political alliances led to disagreements and conflicts between the two churches.

3. Cultural differences: The Roman Catholic Church was influenced by Western European culture, while the Eastern Orthodox Church was rooted in Greek and Eastern European traditions. These cultural differences contributed to misunderstandings and disagreements between the two churches.

4. Iconoclasm: The practice of iconoclasm, or the destruction of religious images, was a significant point of contention between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. The Roman Catholic Church allowed the use of icons, while the Eastern Orthodox Church strictly adhered to the practice of iconoclasm.

5. Translation of the Bible: The Roman Catholic Church supported the use of the Latin Vulgate translation of the Bible, while the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Greek Old and New Testaments. Differences in biblical translations further contributed to the split.

These factors, among others, led to the split between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, which has persisted to this day."

Continental crust is generally older than oceanic crust and is responsible for the majority of Earth's landmasses.

2. Oceanic crust: This type of crust is found underwater, primarily in the ocean basins and is thinner and denser than the continental crust.

On December 12, 1911, George V, Emperor of India, declared that the capital of the Raj would be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.","The British Raj imposed the decision to shift the capital from Calcutta (Kolkata) to Delhi during the British occupation of India. The British East India Company had established their foothold in Calcutta in 1690, and they viewed Delhi as a more strategic location due to its proximity to other major cities and its historical significance as the former capital of the Mughal Empire.

The decision to move the capital was formalized on May 27, 1858, when the British Government of India Act was passed, which transferred the capital from Calcutta to Delhi. This act was a significant step in the British colonization of India, as it aimed to strengthen their control over the region and solidify their presence in the heart of the Indian subcontinent.

The shift to Delhi was not an immediate process, as the British took time to build and establish the required infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and administrative buildings, in the new capital. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Delhi in 1885, marking a significant moment in the struggle for Indian independence.

The decision to shift the capital from Calcutta to Delhi had lasting effects on the political, social, and cultural landscape of India. Delhi became the center of political power and the epicenter of the Indian independence movement, with many prominent leaders, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Subhash Chandra Bose, emerging from the city during this period."

She is best known for her role as the spunky, energetic, and somewhat mischievous character in the 1960s television series ""The Addams Family."" The show, created by Gomez and Morticia Addams, revolves around the peculiar, yet loving, family led by Gomez and Morticia, who reside in a macabre, gothic mansion with their offspring.

Tuesday Addams was born on October 31, 1948, in Santa Monica, California. She was the granddaughter of the famous actress and vaudeville star, Janet Gaynor, and the daughter of John Addams, a film director and producer. The character of Cindy Lou Who was a part of the Addams Family's quirky and eccentric lifestyle, often getting into various misadventures.

In the series, Cindy Lou Who is the younger sister of Pugsley Addams, the only child of Gomez and Morticia. She is characterized by her wild, curly hair, her penchant for dressing in unusual and sometimes eccentric clothing, and her energetic, talkative nature. Her catchphrase, ""Heeeere's Cindy Lou Who!"", is often used to denote her presence and her infectious enthusiasm.

Tuesday Addams appeared in several episodes of ""The Addams Family"" during its three-season run from 1965 to 1969. After the show's conclusion, she continued her acting career in various television series and films. Some of her notable roles include playing Susan Heffley in the ""Ghostbusters"" film series, as well as appearances in shows like ""The Love Boat,"" ""Murder, She Wrote,"" and ""Twin Peaks.""

Sadly, Tuesday Addams passed away on September 27, 1993, due to a heart attack resulting from a drug overdose. She was only 44 years old. Despite her untimely death, she left behind a lasting legacy as an actress and performer who brought joy and entertainment to audiences worldwide through her portrayal of the spirited and unforgettable character Cindy Lou Who in ""The Addams Family."""

He was born in the Netherlands in 1592 and later moved to England, where he became a citizen and obtained an explorer's license. In 1627, Crayon embarked on an expedition to the New World to search for new territories and trade opportunities for the Dutch East India Company.

During his journey, Crayon and his crew sailed along the eastern coast of North America and encountered the Mississippi River in present-day Minnesota, around 1627. Crayon was the first European to document and map the river, naming it ""Missisipy River"" in his journal. However, the name ""Mississippi"" was later anglicized to ""Mississippi"" by European cartographers and became widely used for the river.

Crayon's discovery and early exploration of the Mississippi River played a significant role in the expansion of European influence in the New World and the eventual establishment of trade routes and settlements along its banks."

The event took place from July 19 to August 3, 1980. The men's hockey competition featured eight teams, including Pakistan, and was organized as part of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) efforts to promote the sport worldwide.

In the final match, Pakistan faced off against the heavily favored Soviet Union team on August 3, 1980.

The score was tied 1-1 after regulation play, leading to a tense and highly anticipated overtime period.

In the extra session, neither team could score a goal, and the match advanced to a shootout to determine the gold medalist. The shootout went on for five rounds, with each player attempting to score by hitting the puck into the net. The Soviet goaltender, Valeri Buret, managed to stop all five of Pakistan's shots, while the Soviet forward, Andrei Nazarov, successfully scored the decisive goal in the sixth round, securing a 2-1 victory for the Soviet Union.

According to the ISO 8601, Sunday is the seventh and last day of the week.","Sunday became the seventh day of the week due to the development and spread of the Christian faith. The concept of Sunday as the seventh day of the week can be traced back to its association with the biblical creation story in the Book of Genesis, where it is mentioned that God rested on the seventh day of creation (Genesis 2:3).

In the early Christian church, Sunday was initially observed as a day of worship and rest, following the Jewish tradition of observing the Sabbath (Saturday) as the day of rest. However, the exact origin of the association between Sunday and the seventh day of the week is debated among scholars. Some argue that Sunday was chosen as the day for worship because it was the first day of the week (the ""first day of the week"" is referred to as ""Kyrie"" in Greek) after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is an essential event in Christian theology.

The early Christian church adopted the Roman numeral system (which uses a different counting system from the Jewish) to label the days of the week with the first letter of each word in Latin, resulting in ""Sabbat"" (Saturday) becoming ""Sabbaticus"" (Saturday in Latin) and ""Sunday"" becoming ""Sundius."" Over time, the term ""Sundius"" evolved into ""Sabbat"" in Latin, and the association of Sunday as the seventh day of the week became widely accepted.

In the Middle Ages, Sunday was designated as the day of rest and worship, and many Christian denominations continue to observe this practice today. The Catholic Church, for instance, maintains Sunday as the day of rest and worship, while Protestant denominations, such as the Anglican Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Presbyterian Church, observe Sunday as the day of worship and rest, but not necessarily as the seventh day of the week.

In summary, Sunday became the seventh day of the week due to its association with the biblical creation story and the Christian tradition of worship and rest. The exact origin of the association between Sunday and the seventh day of the week can be traced back to the early Christian church's adoption of the Roman numeral system and the choice of Sunday as the day of worship following Jesus' resurrection."

In ""100,"" Gideon's team is assigned to track down a notorious international terrorist named Dolph Lundgren, who is believed to be planning a major attack.

In Genesis, Jacob spends a night wrestling with an angel who is also referred to as a man and God. The next morning, Jacob is given the name Israel and is blessed.","In the Bible, the individual who fought with an angel is Moses. Specifically, he is described to have fought against the Egyptian army during the Exodus from Egypt in the Book of Exodus. Moses and his brother Aaron went down to the Nile River to retrieve water for their people, and while they were there, an Egyptian pharaoh and his army came to capture them. In Exodus 2:1-10, it narrates the incident where Moses, weighing his ear against harnes, saw the Egyptian army coming to capture him and his brother. To protect them, God called upon Moses to cast down the stone that he had picked up, which had his ear cut off, and then God healed his ear and gave him a new one. This act symbolized his willingness to sacrifice himself to save his people.

In Exodus 3:2-6, God speaks to Moses and instructs him to go to Egypt to lead his people out of it, and to take with him his brother Aaron and a staff that he had picked up from the river. This journey is marked by a series of plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians, culminating in the parting of the Red Sea to make way for the Israelites' escape.

During the final plague, the Egyptian army, led by Pharaoh's commander, pursued the Israelites to the Red Sea. Moses, with God's help, raised his staff and struck the ground, splitting the Red Sea in two. This allowed the Israelites to escape and the Egyptian army was trapped between the two halves of the sea, effectively defeating them.

So, in this battle, it was Moses who fought alongside an angel, represented by God, to protect and lead his people out of Egypt."

"[{'context': 'The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans.

These levels were not distinct, but rather, the game progressed as the player advanced in their score accumulation. Each level featured a different color palette and a unique set of ghosts (the game's antagonists) that chased Pac-Man.

In the original arcade version, players started at the first level, which was primarily colored red and featured fewer ghosts. As the player scored more points and the ghosts got faster, the game transitioned to the second level, which was primarily colored yellow and had more ghosts. The final level was colored orange and featured the most ghosts, making it the most challenging.

Over the years, various home versions of Pac-Man were released, and these levels were often reorganized or renamed. For example, the 1982 arcade version of Pac-Man (known as ""Pac-Man Arrangement"" in Japan and ""Pac-Man Classic"" in the United States) introduced a fourth level with a blue color scheme and more ghosts. However, the original arcade version still retained the three levels from the 1978 release.

In summary, the original Pac-Man arcade game had three levels, with each level featuring a different color palette and a varying number of ghosts. The game transitioned between these levels based on the player's score and the increasing difficulty of the ghosts."

"[{'context': 'In 1950 the Korean War created demand for a military light utility vehicle. The war put a Jeep on Japan\'s doorstep. The United States government ordered 100 vehicles with the then-new Willys specifications and tasked Toyota to manufacture them. The Toyota ""Jeep"" BJ prototype was developed in January 1951. This came from the demand for military-type utility vehicles, much like the British Land Rover Series 1 that was developed in 1948. The Jeep BJ was larger than the original U.S. Jeep and more powerful courtesy of its Type B 3.4-litre six-cylinder OHV Four-stroke petrol engine which generated a power output of at 3,600 rpm and torque at 1,600 rpm. It had a part-time four-wheel drive system like the Jeep. However, and unlike the Jeep, the Jeep BJ had no low-range transfer case. In July 1951, Toyota\'s test driver Ichiro Taira drove the next generation of the Jeep BJ prototype up to the sixth stage of Mount Fuji, the first vehicle to climb that height. The test was overseen by the National Police Agency (NPA).

It is composed of the President, who holds both the legislative and executive powers, and two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The House of Representatives, which is the lower house of the Parliament, consists of a maximum of 159 members. The number of representatives in the House of Representatives is determined by the population of each electoral area within the country. According to the 2016 Population and Housing Census, the total population of Ghana was approximately 27,097,026. Based on this figure, each electoral area is expected to have a minimum of approximately 209,904.5 registered voters (rounded to the nearest whole number). Consequently, the total number of seats in the House of Representatives would be approximately 42,018 (159 representatives ÷ 209,904.5).

The Senate, on the other hand, is the upper house of the Parliament and has 23 members. The number of senators in the Senate is determined by the total number of registered voters in the country. As of the 2016 Population and Housing Census, Ghana had a total of approximately 27,097,026 registered voters. Therefore, the total number of seats in the Senate would be approximately 603 (23 senators ÷ 27,097,026).

In summary, the Parliament of Ghana consists of the President, the House of Representatives with approximately 42,018 seats, and the Senate with 23 seats."

The Tin Man, who doesn't have a heart, is played by Jack Haley in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.","In the Wizard of Oz, the Scarecrow had no heart. The Scarecrow was a character created by L. Frank Baum as a part of his novel, originally published in 1900. The Scarecrow was initially designed to be a prank on the other characters in the story, but he eventually became an important symbol in the story.

The Scarecrow was made from straw and was designed to be a guardian of the cornfield where Dorothy and her friends were searching for the magical yellow brick road that would take them to see the Wizard of Oz. The Scarecrow was programmed to run after anything that moved, and he was supposed to protect the cornfield from being destroyed by the wicked witch, Glinda, who had cast a spell on the entire Oz.

However, the Scarecrow lacked a heart, which made him unable to truly understand the importance of helping others and protecting the land he was supposed to guard. This lack of a heart made the Scarecrow an ineffective guardian and a comic figure in the story.

Throughout the novel, the Scarecrow's ineffectiveness becomes apparent as he fails to protect Dorothy and her friends from the dangers they face in the cornfield. Eventually, Dorothy and her friends manage to outsmart the Scarecrow by tricking him into thinking they were still inside the cornfield, while they were actually on their way to the witch's castle. This allowed them to escape the witch's clutches and continue their journey to see the Wizard of Oz.

In conclusion, the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz had no heart, which made him an ineffective guardian and a comical character in the story. This lack of empathy and understanding of his purpose led to his failure as a protector, and it was ultimately a contributing factor to Dorothy's successful escape from the witch's clutches."

This process starts with the mitotic division of the stem cells located close to the basement membrane of the tubules. These cells are called spermatogonial stem cells.

The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two primary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two equal haploid spermatids by Meiosis II. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa(sperm) by the process of spermiogenesis. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells.

In ""Game of Thrones,"" Lord Beric is a former member of the Stark family, who initially appears as a wildling and later becomes a prominent figure in the story during the War of the Five Kings.

Throughout the series, Lord Beric undergoes a significant transformation, as his right hand and face are burned off during a battle.
