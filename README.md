# An Evaluation Framework for Attributed Information Retrieval using Large Language Models

Search engines are now adopting generative approaches to provide  answers along with in-line citations as attribution. While existing work focuses mainly on attributed question answering (QA), we target information-seeking scenarios which are often more challenging. This repository maintains a framework to evaluate and benchmark attributed information seeking. We implement three key architectures commonly used for attribution, extendable to any LLM or LLM-based approach: (1) Generate (2) Retrieve then Generate, and (3) Generate then Retrieve.
